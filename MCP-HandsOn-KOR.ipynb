      "Self-RAG(Self-Reflective Retrieval Augmented Generation)는 검색 기반 생성(RAG) 전략의 한 종류로, 검색된 문서와 생성된 내용에 대한 자기 성찰(self-reflection) 및 자기 평가(self-grading)를 통합한 방식입니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Self-RAG의 주요 특징:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **자기 성찰 메커니즘**: \n",
      "   - 검색된 문서가 질문과 관련이 있는지 평가\n",
      "   - 생성된 답변이 검색된 문서에 근거하는지 평가(환각 방지)\n",
      "   - 생성된 답변이 질문에 적절히 대응하는지 평가\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **의사결정 프로세스**:\n",
      "   - 검색기(retriever)를 사용할지 여부 결정\n",
      "   - 검색된 문서의 관련성 평가\n",
      "   - 생성된 답변의 품질 및 신뢰성 평가\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **평가 단계**:\n",
      "   - 문서 관련성 평가: 검색된 문서가 질문과 관련 있는지 판단 (관련 있음/없음)\n",
      "   - 환각 평가: 생성된 답변이 검색된 문서에 근거하는지 판단 (완전 지원/부분 지원/지원 없음)\n",
      "   - 유용성 평가: 생성된 답변이 질문에 유용한지 평가 (5점 척도)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Self-RAG의 작동 방식:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. 질문 입력 시 검색기를 통해 관련 문서 검색\n",
      "2. 검색된 각 문서의 관련성 평가 및 필터링\n",
      "3. 관련 문서가 없으면 질문 재구성(transform query)\n",
      "4. 관련 문서가 있으면 답변 생성\n",
      "5. 생성된 답변이 문서에 근거하는지, 질문에 적절한지 평가\n",
      "6. 평가 결과에 따라 답변 수용 또는 재생성\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-RAG는 기존 RAG 시스템의 한계를 극복하기 위해 설계되었으며, 검색된 정보의 관련성과 생성된 답변의 품질을 지속적으로 모니터링하고 개선하는 자기 교정 메커니즘을 통해 더 정확하고 신뢰할 수 있는 답변을 제공합니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "이 접근 방식은 2023년 발표된 논문 \"Self-RAG: Learning to Retrieve, Generate, and Critique through Self-Reflection\"(https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511)에서 제안되었으며, LangGraph를 사용하여 효과적으로 구현할 수 있습니다."

He's very cocky. A little arrogance is OK. But the problem is that when you're arrogant, you need to deliver.\\n“You need to back it up. This was a real slap in the face for him.”\\nLawson replaced Sergio Perez at the end of the 2024 campaign as the Mexican struggled for performance for much of the year.\\nThe pair came to blows at Perez's home race last year as they clashed wheels, later resulting in Lawson sticking his middle finger up at Perez as he overtook the 35-year-old.\\nAs a result, Montoya has suggested the Mexican F1 fanbase is enjoying seeing Lawson struggle at Red Bull.\\n“The Mexicans will be loving this because he gave Checo the middle finger last year because supposedly Perez was a terrible driver,” he added.\\n“Now you see them in the same car and he's worse than Perez.\\n“It’s been a very humbling experience for Liam. I think it will help him put everything into perspective.\\n“If he doesn’t panic and if he stays in the moment and just goes and drives the car, I think Liam can do a really good job.”\\nAlso interesting:\\nWATCH: Lawson branded a ‘mistake’ as Red Bull make brutal change\\nJoin RacingNews365's Ian Parkes and Nick Golding as they analyse the huge news from Red Bull, who confirmed Yuki Tsunoda will replace Liam Lawson at the team.\\n10 years of RN365: Win amazing F1 prizes!\\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel and win an F1 scale model car of your favourite driver!\\nWin amazing F1 prizes!\\nMost read\\nMcLaren shuts down historic F1 'steal' claim Today, 12:50 0\\nRed Bull make new Verstappen contract exit clause revelation Today, 10:05 0\\nF1 fans send Red Bull clear Liam Lawson sacking verdict Today, 08:15 0\\nF1 Podcast Red Bull emergency meeting as Ferrari review disqualifications 24 March at 15:00 0\\nLewis Hamilton agrees with Max Verstappen over major F1 rule change Today, 06:55 0\\n'It's an open secret' - Wolff makes 2026 Mercedes F1 driver line-up revelation Today, 06:00 0\\nIn this article\\nLiam Lawson\\nF1 news\\nFormula 1\\nF1 2025\\nFormula 1 news\\nF1\\nRed Bull Racing\\nJuan Pablo Montoya\\nJoin the conversation!\\nBe the first to react!\\nLatest news\\nMcLaren shuts down historic F1 'steal' claim Today, 12:50 0 Perez offers clue over future amid F1 return rumours Today, 11:55 0 Red Bull make new Verstappen contract exit clause revelation Today, 10:05 0 Revealed: How long Yuki Tsunoda will have to prove himself at Red Bull Today, 09:10 0 F1 fans send Red Bull clear Liam Lawson sacking verdict Today, 08:15 0\\nMore news\\nLatest news\\nMcLaren shuts down historic F1 'steal' claim Today, 12:50 0Perez offers clue over future amid F1 return rumours Today, 11:55 0Lawson handed second ‘arrogance’ evaluation after Red Bull axe Today, 11:00 0Red Bull make new Verstappen contract exit clause revelation Today, 10:05 0Revealed: How long Yuki Tsunoda will have to prove himself at Red Bull Today, 09:10 0F1 fans send Red Bull clear Liam Lawson sacking verdict Today, 08:15 0Red Bull handed staggering '10th fastest F1 team' ranking Today, 07:20 0Lewis Hamilton agrees with Max Verstappen over major F1 rule change Today, 06:55 0'It's an open secret' - Wolff makes 2026 Mercedes F1 driver line-up revelation Today, 06:00 0Jos Verstappen backs Lawson as FIA clampdown reportedly impacts McLaren - RacingNews365 Review Yesterday, 21:00 0More news\\nF1 standings 2025\\nDrivers Teams\\n| # | Driver | Points |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 |\\nLando Norris McLaren\\n| 44 |\\n| 2 |\\nMax Verstappen Red Bull\\n| 36 |\\n| 3 |\\nGeorge Russell Mercedes\\n| 35 |\\n| 4 |\\nOscar Piastri McLaren\\n| 34 |\\n| 5 |\\nKimi Antonelli Mercedes\\n| 22 |\\n| 6 |\\nAlexander Albon Williams\\n| 16 |\\n| # | Team | Points |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 |\\nMcLaren Norris & Piastri\\n| 78 |\\n| 2 |\\nMercedes Russell & Antonelli\\n| 57 |\\n| 3 |\\nRed Bull Verstappen & Tsunoda\\n| 36 |\\n| 4 |\\nWilliams Sainz & Albon\\n| 17 |\\n| 5 |\\nFerrari Leclerc & Hamilton\\n| 17 |\\n| 6 |\\nHaas Ocon & Bearman\\n| 14 |\\nFull standings\\nF1 calendar 2025\\n| Race | Date |\\n| --- | --- |\\n|\\nJapanese Suzuka Circuit\\n| 6 Apr |\\n|\\nBahrain Bahrain International Circuit\\n| 13 Apr |\\n|\\nSaudi Arabian Jeddah Street Circuit\\n| 20 Apr |\\n|\\nMiami Miami International Autodrome\\n| 4 May |\\n|\\nEmilia Romagna Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari\\n| 18 May |\\nFull calendar\\nWelcome at RacingNews365\\nBecome part of the largest racing community in the United Kingdom.

The actor left his $80million fortune to Arakawa\\nArakawa is survived by her 91-year-old mother, Yoshie Feaster, who also is suffering from dementia.\\nSince Arakawa's only living relative is her mother —and her mother has dementia — she likely lacks the legal capacity to make those decisions.\\nA New Mexico court last week granted a temporary restraining order against the release of any photographs and video showing Hackman and his wife the inside of their home.

A representative for the couple’s estate has cited that privacy in seeking to block the public release of autopsy and investigative reports related to their deaths, especially photographs and video. It will be up to a state district judge to consider that request.\\nThe couple’s German shepherd, named Bear, survived along with a second dog named Nikita, according to Joey Padilla, owner of the Santa Fe Tails pet care, where Hackman and Arakawa often boarded their dogs.
