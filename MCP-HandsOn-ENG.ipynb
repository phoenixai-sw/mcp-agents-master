Over 100 people complained to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about the “Not Like Us” rapper’s performance, and—at least as far as we know—none of them were Drake. Instead, the people were generally mad about Lamar’s language and “gestures” (which ones? unclear), as well as the fact that “not one white person” was featured onstage. Even if Drake wanted to hire people to make a fuss, they probably would have been more creative than that.\\nAccording to a report from The Hill, multiple complaints took issue with Lamar’s “provocative dancing” because, apparently, America can’t handle a man in bell bottoms. “The halftime show was terrible with the language and gestures. My younger kids did not need to see and hear this!” one viewer wrote. “That was the worst halftime show that I have ever seen,” another from North Carolina submitted. “I’m glad that I couldn’t understand most of what Kendrick Lamar was saying because I read the lyrics to a few of his songs, and I am appalled.” If those kids could read, they’d also be very upset.\\nMost Popular\\nA WTF-inducing White Lotus sets up some explosive confrontations\\nThe White Lotus' Jon Gries on that face-off with Belinda and why Greg is a \\\"run-of-the-mill psychopath\\\"\\nLost media detectives finally found the full original pilot for Family Guy\\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\\nAll of the profanity in Lamar’s performance was censored or left out, and it’s unclear exactly which words had the complainees so offended. Still, another opined that “it would be a nice change to have entertainment that truly shows what America should be; family, country, decency and respect.” They do kind of have him there.\\nOther viewers complained that the performance was “racist” and “anti-white” for featuring mostly Black dancers. “There wasn’t one white person in the whole show,” one person complained, while another wrote: “They get away with it but if it was all white it would be a different story. The halftime show should have both Black and white and be appropriate for everyone. This was a disgrace and it gets worse every year.”\\nRelated Content\\nKendrick Lamar set a Super Bowl viewership record as big as the Eiffel Tower\\nThe Super Bowl was just another game for Kendrick Lamar to win\\nSome people didn’t even know what they were complaining about. “I want to know why is it that there was not one white person involved????” one person from Florida submitted. “I felt discriminated against and why was Uncle Sam Black when Uncle Sam is white?” Uncle Sam is not real.\\n125 people complained overall, per the outlet. Considering Lamar broke records with 127.7 million total viewers, that also means hundreds of millions didn’t complain. (For context, the FCC received over 540,000 complaints after Nipplegate, per The Hollywood Reporter.) That seems like another solid win for Lamar.\\nMore from A.V.

He's very cocky. A little arrogance is OK. But the problem is that when you're arrogant, you need to deliver.\\n“You need to back it up. This was a real slap in the face for him.”\\nLawson replaced Sergio Perez at the end of the 2024 campaign as the Mexican struggled for performance for much of the year.\\nThe pair came to blows at Perez's home race last year as they clashed wheels, later resulting in Lawson sticking his middle finger up at Perez as he overtook the 35-year-old.\\nAs a result, Montoya has suggested the Mexican F1 fanbase is enjoying seeing Lawson struggle at Red Bull.\\n“The Mexicans will be loving this because he gave Checo the middle finger last year because supposedly Perez was a terrible driver,” he added.\\n“Now you see them in the same car and he's worse than Perez.\\n“It’s been a very humbling experience for Liam. I think it will help him put everything into perspective.\\n“If he doesn’t panic and if he stays in the moment and just goes and drives the car, I think Liam can do a really good job.”\\nAlso interesting:\\nWATCH: Lawson branded a ‘mistake’ as Red Bull make brutal change\\nJoin RacingNews365's Ian Parkes and Nick Golding as they analyse the huge news from Red Bull, who confirmed Yuki Tsunoda will replace Liam Lawson at the team.\\n10 years of RN365: Win amazing F1 prizes!\\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel and win an F1 scale model car of your favourite driver!\\nWin amazing F1 prizes!\\nMost read\\nMcLaren shuts down historic F1 'steal' claim Today, 12:50 0\\nRed Bull make new Verstappen contract exit clause revelation Today, 10:05 0\\nF1 fans send Red Bull clear Liam Lawson sacking verdict Today, 08:15 0\\nF1 Podcast Red Bull emergency meeting as Ferrari review disqualifications 24 March at 15:00 0\\nLewis Hamilton agrees with Max Verstappen over major F1 rule change Today, 06:55 0\\n'It's an open secret' - Wolff makes 2026 Mercedes F1 driver line-up revelation Today, 06:00 0\\nIn this article\\nLiam Lawson\\nF1 news\\nFormula 1\\nF1 2025\\nFormula 1 news\\nF1\\nRed Bull Racing\\nJuan Pablo Montoya\\nJoin the conversation!\\nBe the first to react!\\nLatest news\\nMcLaren shuts down historic F1 'steal' claim Today, 12:50 0 Perez offers clue over future amid F1 return rumours Today, 11:55 0 Red Bull make new Verstappen contract exit clause revelation Today, 10:05 0 Revealed: How long Yuki Tsunoda will have to prove himself at Red Bull Today, 09:10 0 F1 fans send Red Bull clear Liam Lawson sacking verdict Today, 08:15 0\\nMore news\\nLatest news\\nMcLaren shuts down historic F1 'steal' claim Today, 12:50 0Perez offers clue over future amid F1 return rumours Today, 11:55 0Lawson handed second ‘arrogance’ evaluation after Red Bull axe Today, 11:00 0Red Bull make new Verstappen contract exit clause revelation Today, 10:05 0Revealed: How long Yuki Tsunoda will have to prove himself at Red Bull Today, 09:10 0F1 fans send Red Bull clear Liam Lawson sacking verdict Today, 08:15 0Red Bull handed staggering '10th fastest F1 team' ranking Today, 07:20 0Lewis Hamilton agrees with Max Verstappen over major F1 rule change Today, 06:55 0'It's an open secret' - Wolff makes 2026 Mercedes F1 driver line-up revelation Today, 06:00 0Jos Verstappen backs Lawson as FIA clampdown reportedly impacts McLaren - RacingNews365 Review Yesterday, 21:00 0More news\\nF1 standings 2025\\nDrivers Teams\\n| # | Driver | Points |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 |\\nLando Norris McLaren\\n| 44 |\\n| 2 |\\nMax Verstappen Red Bull\\n| 36 |\\n| 3 |\\nGeorge Russell Mercedes\\n| 35 |\\n| 4 |\\nOscar Piastri McLaren\\n| 34 |\\n| 5 |\\nKimi Antonelli Mercedes\\n| 22 |\\n| 6 |\\nAlexander Albon Williams\\n| 16 |\\n| # | Team | Points |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 |\\nMcLaren Norris & Piastri\\n| 78 |\\n| 2 |\\nMercedes Russell & Antonelli\\n| 57 |\\n| 3 |\\nRed Bull Verstappen & Tsunoda\\n| 36 |\\n| 4 |\\nWilliams Sainz & Albon\\n| 17 |\\n| 5 |\\nFerrari Leclerc & Hamilton\\n| 17 |\\n| 6 |\\nHaas Ocon & Bearman\\n| 14 |\\nFull standings\\nF1 calendar 2025\\n| Race | Date |\\n| --- | --- |\\n|\\nJapanese Suzuka Circuit\\n| 6 Apr |\\n|\\nBahrain Bahrain International Circuit\\n| 13 Apr |\\n|\\nSaudi Arabian Jeddah Street Circuit\\n| 20 Apr |\\n|\\nMiami Miami International Autodrome\\n| 4 May |\\n|\\nEmilia Romagna Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari\\n| 18 May |\\nFull calendar\\nWelcome at RacingNews365\\nBecome part of the largest racing community in the United Kingdom.

She was only 16, but it strangely made sense. All the early mornings, the rigorous training, the unrelenting pressure, the moments of her childhood she was missing: it was time for her to do something else.\\nShe had become the youngest U.S. women’s champion ever at 13, then she won the national title again at 14. She was so tiny that the skaters she defeated had to pull her up to the top rung of the medal podium. At 16, she competed in the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, finishing sixth. She won the bronze medal at the 2022 world championships a month later, then soon afterward posted on Instagram that she was done with the sport.\\n“I’m going to be moving on with my life,” Liu wrote.\\nFlash forward to Friday night, March 28, 2025. Liu, now 19 and unretired, sailed through her triple jumps as if without a care in the world in her four-minute long program, delivering a breezy, delightful and whimsical performance to become the first U.S. woman in 19 years to win the world championship — with the 2026 Winter Olympic Games little more than 10 months away.\\n“Just what the hell?” Liu said when she was done, laughing as she perfectly summed up one of the most remarkable comeback stories in her sport’s history. Skaters don’t just disappear, reappear and then win world titles — but that’s exactly what Liu just did.\\n“Even yesterday, I didn’t expect this,” she said, referring to holding the lead after Wednesday’s short program. “I didn’t have expectations coming in. I never have expectations coming into competitions anymore. It’s more of what I can put out performance-wise and I really met my expectations on that part today.”\\nShe was competing with a new-found freedom, given a second chance at the sport and a life she loves. She cartwheeled through the entry walkway before taking the ice for the short program, and she did it again Friday night when her name was called for the medal ceremony. In this pressure-packed sport where one stumble on the slippery ice can ruin the dreams of a lifetime, few if any have handled their nerves better than Liu did here over the past three days.\\nIt was noticeable to her competitors. “I feel like her cheerfulness, her kindness and the way she’s always so happy brought her to this position on top of the podium,” said three-time defending champion Kaori Sakamoto of Japan, who finished second. “In fact, I would say something has changed because she’s more bright, she’s happier now.”\\nIn the time she was away from skating, Liu attended UCLA and did things she never was allowed to do when she was competing, like going skiing for the first time. Trying out a new sport ended up rekindling her love for her first one, so about a year ago, she began practicing again, hoping to get back into skating shape. Whatever her goal was, it definitely wasn’t this.\\nShe became the first American woman to win a world title since Kimmie Meissner in 2006, but there’s a difference in the timing, and significance, of those titles. Meissner won hers a month after the Olympic Games, while Liu’s victory leads right into the Olympic year. She has now become a medal favorite for the Milan Games, and if she were to win an Olympic medal of any color, she would become the first American woman to do so since Sasha Cohen won the silver medal in 2006, and before that, Sarah Hughes won the gold and Michelle Kwan the bronze in 2002.\\nWhatever comes next for Liu will be both fascinating and unexpected. “I have never regretted anything in my life,” she said. “Every decision I’ve made, I’m so glad I did. It really brought me to this moment.”\\nA second chance at 19.

And you can even make a phone call through the new washer and dryer.\\nby Jennifer Pattison Tuohy\\nMar 30, 2025, 2:00 AM UTC\\n2 Comments / 2 New\\nSamaung’s new Bespoke AI Jet Ultra cordless stick vacuum has an\\nAI cleaning mode that senses floor types and automatically adjusts suction power and brush speed.\\nImage: Samsung\\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy is a smart home reporter who’s been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News.\\nIn our notification-heavy world, there is still one activity where you might just miss that buzz on your phone or ping on your smartwatch – while you’re vacuuming. Thankfully, Samsung has a solution.\\nIts newest cordless stick vac, the new Bespoke AI Jet Ultra ($1,099), now has an LCD display control panel that, along with standard features such as power level and battery life, can notify you when you have an incoming phone call or text message. The vacuum, which works with an auto-empty charging station, also features 400AW suction and 100-minute battery life.\\nEven better, if you’re doing the wash and left your phone in the other room, Samsung’s added touchscreens to its washers and dryers, including the new Bespoke AI Laundry Vented Combo washer / dryer ($3,099). This lets you answer a call directly on the built-in 7-inch LCD screen. The Combo can also (perhaps more usefully) put detergent in for you automatically and then, when the cycle is done, open its door.\\nThe new Bespoke combo washer and dryer has several tech upgrades, including a new 7-inch touchscreen that you can make phone calls on.\\nImage: Samsung\\nThe company has been rolling out the ability to answer your phone from your appliance to its entire Bespoke AI line. At CES this year, Samsung showed off these AI Home control panels on several appliances, including its new Bespoke AI smart fridges and wall ovens. The features work with Android and iOS and require a Samsung account and the SmartThings app.\\nAI Home is a new terminology Samsung uses to refer to the 7- or 9-inch LCD screens on its products and the screens built into its flagship Family Hub smart fridge. The fridge now has the option of a slimmed-down screen that — like the other AI Home screens — includes music, weather, and cooking apps, and smart home controls.\\nOf course, you can still get the fridge with a giant 21.5-inch or 32-inch screen that can run even more apps, including Samsung TV and TikTok. These screens all also work as controls for the appliance and integrate with other Samsung appliances and services, sometimes using AI.\\nThe flagship Samsung Family Hub smart fridge now comes with the option of a smaller screen.\\nFor example, on the fridge screen, you can look up a recipe in the Samsung Food app using ingredients it has identified you have using its AI-powered cameras. You can then send the cooking instructions to your oven and use the screen to view the recipe. It’s like having your phone with you everywhere, except your hands are free.\\nThe AI Home screens can connect to Samsung’s SmartThings smart home platform. That means you can get alerts on your appliances about other events in your smart home, for example, you can see (and talk to) whoever is at your Ring video doorbell while unloading the washer.\\nSamsung’s “screens everywhere” approach is part of its AI for the home push, its vision of tech working in the background to help you with your daily life. While the smart home has plenty of potential to save you time, money, and energy, putting screens into everything feels like overkill. A smart display could serve much of the same purpose, and would probably cost less to replace than a cooktop when you drop a pan on its screen.\\nTech-heavy touchscreens built into appliances also feel susceptible to obsolescence, not to mention being more likely to malfunction than that plastic knob on your washing machine. The other concern about screens in the home is that they could be used to serve up ads, as is the case with Amazon’s Echo Show smart displays. While Samsung has not done this yet on its appliances, it’s an understandable worry. The Verge reached out to Samsung about these concerns and will follow up with the company’s response.\\n2 Comments / 2 New\\nSee More:\\nNews\\nSamsung\\nSmart Home\\nTech\\nMore in this stream\\nSee all\\nFirst Alert’s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacement\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 2823\\nGoogle discontinues Nest Protect smoke alarm and Nest x Yale door lock\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 2838\\nYale’s new smart lock can match your Google Nest doorbell\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 285\\nMost Popular\\nMost Popular\\nGoogle discontinues Nest Protect smoke alarm and Nest x Yale door lock\\nKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starter\\nWindows 11 is closing a loophole that let you skip making a Microsoft account\\nHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUs\\nMadison Square Garden’s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt design\\nInstaller\\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\\nEmail (required)\\nSign Up\\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

A spokesperson for Columbia declined to comment on individual students.\\nChungin “Roy” Lee, 21, has been using social media to document the consequences of using AI to cheat on his internship interviews.Courtesy Roy Lee\\nSavewith a NBCUniversal Profile\\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\\nMarch 27, 2025, 9:51 PM UTC\\nBy Angela Yang\\nA computer science student at Columbia University said he has been kicked out by the school after he built an artificial intelligence tool to cheat in tech job interviews and documented the fallout online.\\nChungin “Roy” Lee, a second-year undergraduate, garnered online attention after he claimed to have fooled four of the world’s biggest companies using Interview Coder, a desktop app he created to discreetly solve technical coding questions.\\nIn a now-removed YouTube video, Lee 21, recorded himself using the tool during an internship interview with Amazon. His app, which he said took only four days to build, allows users to take screenshots of problems without being detected by their browsers. It then processes the images using AI to spit out solutions in real time.\\nRoy Lee uploaded a now-deleted video to YouTube showcasing how he used Interview Coder during an interview with Amazon.Courtesy Roy Lee\\nIt was a stunt that highlighted the proliferation of generative AI technology in everything from schoolwork to technical jobs, as users discover new tools to help them cover for their lack of skill or knowledge or to otherwise enhance their abilities. As such tools advance, schools and workplaces have struggled to accurately detect their use.“I think 99% people probably haven’t realized how far-reaching this could be,” Lee told NBC News. “In the past, you could have built an invisible desktop assistant, and you also could have used LLMs [large language models] to solve problems. But now that people are putting the two together, I think no form of online assessment is safe.”\\nLee, who is in New York City, said he got the internship offer from Amazon this year. In February, he went online to broadcast that he “used AI to pass my Amazon Interview.” (The video got about 100,000 views before YouTube removed it, citing a copyright claim by Amazon.)\\nLee claims he used Interview Coder to nab offers from all four of the companies he tested it on: Amazon, Capital One, Meta and TikTok. He said that he rejected Amazon’s offer and that several of the other companies rescinded their offers after he publicly posted about his use of AI.\\nRecommended\\nImmigration\\nImmigrationHow a TikTok network spreading Spanish-language immigration misinformation gained traction\\nSecurity\\nSecurityHow the Signal app used in text group can leave the door open for spies and hackers\\nAs a result of his publicized stunt, Columbia University ushered Lee through a disciplinary process that resulted in a yearlong suspension, he said. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment on individual students, citing Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act regulations.\\nMargaret Callahan, a spokesperson for Amazon, said that while the company welcomes candidates’ sharing their experiences working with generative AI tools when it’s relevant to the roles they’re applying for, they must also acknowledge that they won’t use unauthorized tools — such as generative AI technology — to help them during the interview or assessment process.\\nCapital One, Meta and TikTok didn’t respond to requests for comment.\\nSince he began documenting his journey on social media roughly a month ago, Lee said, Interview Coder has had user growth of 50% week over week, and it’s now making $170,000 in monthly subscriptions.\\nHe has continued building his brand online as a combative rule breaker by posting what he claims to be emails with recruiters and documents from his subsequent disciplinary process with Columbia. He has gained more than 43,000 new followers on X, where he has seen the most support for his stunt. On LinkedIn, where he has also gained about new 11,000 followers, the reactions have been more mixed, with some users calling his product “morally unethical” or “corrupt.”\\nRoy Lee says he's not worried about burning bridges and has no plans to return to Columbia after his suspension.Roy Lee\\nLee said he’s “not really worried about burning bridges” within the academic and corporate worlds at the start of his career, as he prefers to invest in entrepreneurship.\\nTrolling the companies, he said, was an act of protest against what he perceives as their overreliance on LeetCode, a popular online platform that provides preparatory questions for coding interviews.\\n“I was in the top 2% of global LeetCode users, and this was probably, like, the 600 most miserable hours of my life when programming,” Lee said. “The questions are not indicative of what you do in the real world. They’re riddles that you have to memorize.”\\nOther AI-powered interview cheating apps, such as Leetcode Wizard, which touts successful results for thousands of users, have also become increasingly popular during the generative AI boom of recent years.\\nSome of them specifically tap into what many software engineers have expressed as a growing disillusionment with LeetCode.\\nLeetCode “doesn’t properly allow engineers to demonstrate their abilities when it comes to programming, while also ignoring the use of AI in daily programming work,” Isabel de Vries, Leetcode Wizard’s head of marketing, said in a statement. “It’s understandable that candidates would want to use similar tools during their interviews.”\\nLee said he knew posting his Amazon interview would be a “really visual, viral way” to tackle the issue that motivated him to create Interview Coder in the first place. He said success would mean getting big tech companies to change their interview formats. Now that tools like his are rising in use and popularity, the genie can’t be put back in the bottle.\\n“I think cheating on these online assessment interviews is really much more common than people think,” Lee said. “Many CS students who are pretty serious about recruiting and stuff know that there are apps like this. It’s just not understood at a large scale.”\\nAngela Yang\\nAngela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.\\nAbout\\nContact\\nHelp\\nCareers\\nAd Choices\\nPrivacy Policy\\nYour Privacy Choices\\nCA Notice\\nTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)\\nNBC News Sitemap\\nClosed Captioning\\nAdvertise\\nSelect Shopping\\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC\\n![Image 10](https://tag.researchnow.com/t/beacon?adn=13&ca=direct&pl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Ftech%2Ftech-news%2Fcolumbia-university-student-trolls-big-tech-ai-tool-job-applications-rcna198454&pr=284801&si=NBCNEWS)\\nResidents of one of the states listed in the ‘Your Rights’ section of NBCUniversal’s Privacy Policy we have received your Global Privacy Control signal or you have opted out from the toggle below, but there is another step.

In a recent development, Samsung has provided the Best Face AI feature to Galaxy S24 and S23 users with the latest One UI 7 Beta update.\\nWith the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung introduced Best Face, with the feature now available on the Galaxy S24 and S23 series and the A56. Levaraging AI, the functionality allows you to fix an individual or group photo effortlessly.\\nYou may have encountered a big issue while taking group selfies or pictures. In a group photo, the face of an individual or more may lead you to capture another photo due to closed eyes, different view point angle or any odd aspect.\\nWell, you will no longer need to capture dozens of photos to get the best group shot.\\nBest Face\\nWhen enabled, Best Face displays improvements for faces in a group shot. You can pick the most preferred shot from the display once and apply the fix. It will swiftly apply the chosen face on the individual while keeping others intact.\\nAdvertisement\\nNotably, Best Face only shows suggestions when the picture is captured in Motion Photo mode.

The update brings at least four new features and system improvements. Meanwhile, Gemini Live is causing One UI Home to crash on the Galaxy S23 series running One UI 7 Beta 2.\\nSamsung’s system launcher for home keeps crashing on the Galaxy S23 series with One UI 7 Beta 2, probably due to Gemini Live. It seems the new Google Assistant isn’t accurately optimized for the Galaxy S23 series, causing crash problems.\\nUsers of the Galaxy S23 series report that the home screen renders useless and then a crashing notice appears. The said notice allows the user to either wait for the system to respond or end the task to immediately resolve the problem.\\nNotably, users are able to reproduce the glitch. It happens when you open Gemini Live and then trigger the Live Notifications. As soon as you land on the home screen, the problem will appear, making the screen useless until the crash notice appears.\\nSince the issue is causing under Beta Program, it isn’t a big deal. As many users spotted the same problem, Samsung will address it in the next Beta update. There might also be a Beta 2 Hotfix to resolve the crashing issue quickly.\\nAdvertisement\\nApart from this, the home screen has another issue related to the Large Folders feature. The folder popup lacks a blur background, which reduces the uniformity of the software. A similar issue was spotted on the Galaxy S24’s One UI 7 Beta earlier.\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nUser interest for One UI 7 overshadowed Android 15 and 16\\nPublished\\n1 day agoon\\nMarch 27, 2025\\nBy\\nChanakya Shrutam\\nWeb searches for One UI 7 have increased on the internet for the past two months and already surpassed Android 15 and the upcoming version simultaneously in terms of users’ interest.\\nAndroid is the world’s largest mobile operating system, making an ecosystem of hundreds of companies, and Samsung has a unique role in popularizing Google’s OS with its vast device range.\\nIn the past five years, Samsung has deepened Android ecosystem’s integration in One UI. For example, it dropped some of the home-grown Google apps and service alternatives to act ‘more’ like an Android.\\nDespite an Android base, One UI 7 has gained massive popularity, which didn’t happen before, and here we’ll explore the possible reasons for this new development.\\nNew Upgrades\\nSamsung unveiled One UI 7 with major upgrades in animations, user interface and operational fluency. The software experience is much better than it predecessor, which is captivating for existing smartphone owners.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe beta program started with the Galaxy S24 series, 2024’s flagship phones, which triggered global media coverage about One UI 7 beta. The users were excited about new additions, revealed by early beta testers, generating excitement.\\nS25\\nThe real One UI 7 hype began with the Galaxy S25 series launch in mid-January. This new flagship was the first to pack with a stable software and a couple of additional features that weren’t even available for beta testers at that time.\\nThis year, Samsung majorly focused its launch event on the software and AI features compared and less on the hardware.\\nAgain, the majority of the media covered the Galaxy S25 series’ software side, making it even more compelling to the previous flagship users.\\nRollout delay\\nOne UI 7 is a big update, but its rollout delay is quite unsatisfying. The majority of Galaxy users weren’t aware of the One UI 7 (Android 15) rollout. This release suspense has garnered a mass internet search about eligible devices and release date.\\nAdvertisement\\nThis trend remained the same after the S25 release and picked up pace with every rumor and leak about this software’ release. On March 18, an official press-release finally unraveled Samsung’s April plan for One UI 7, ending this long-standing mystery.\\nSearch Trends\\nSince early December, I’ve seen tons of online articles about this new update. I also take a look at the Google Trends search volume from December 1, 2024, to March 25, 2025.\\nIt shows that One UI 7’s search volume is on par with Android 15, but its search interest is above both Android versions.\\nIt’s not about competition between Samsung and Google, instead, the search reflects the higher user interest in Samsung’s software technologies.\\nThis is also good for Google in terms of partnership with Samsung and promoting new capabilities such as Gemini and circle to search in Galaxy devices.\\nAdvertisement\\nStill, Samsung needs to work on its rollout efficiency to delivery software updates on time.\\nSource – Google Trends\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nOne UI 7 Beta 2 update live for Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, Tab S10 Ultra\\nPublished\\n2 days agoon\\nMarch 27, 2025\\nBy\\nSheetal\\nSamsung has pushed the One UI 7 Beta 2 update for Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra devices.

Yes, the Galaxy S25 launched with it, but it’s been months now and owners of the super-premium Galaxy S24 Ultra, or the Galaxy Z Fold 6 haven’t gotten a taste of the new Samsung software.\\nApple has failed to provide the massive Siri update we were supposed to get with iOS 18.4, and Samsung may have a 7-year software update promise, but if it takes months to get the new stuff, users start getting irritated.\\nAt least it’s now been confirmed — older Galaxies will be getting One UI 7 on the 7th of April if you are outside the States. In the USA, you will get it on the 10th.\\nHere's what you should expect to see:\\nSlightly redesigned icons\\nNew widgets with multiple shapes and designs for the Samsung apps\\nA new, vertical app drawer (switches to horizontal if you select Custom sorting, but that's a pain)\\nNotifications and Quick Toggles now separated — swipe down from top-right for the quick panel\\nNow Bar - a persistent, active widget, like the Dynamic Island\\nUpdated AI select - the old Smart Select that resided in the Edge Panel is now branded AI select as it automatically suggests actions\\nCamera app facelift - moving the controls around to make it cleaner and one-hand friendly\\nAI search in Samsung Gallery and Settings (maybe not coming to S21?)\\nNow Brief - a quick summary of your day and suggested actions\\nFaster Circle to Search - now automatically suggests actions based on selected content (call number, compose to email address, et cetera)\\nGenerate unique stickers with AI - new AI key in the Samsung Emoji keyboard (maybe not coming to S21?)\\nReceive the latest Samsung news\\nSubscribe\\nBy subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.\\nSome visual elements of One UI 7 have been criticized for moving away from the Samsung look and style — like the new quick toggles menu, which kind of looks like an iPhone Control Center if you squint. However, the smart search in Settings will be a big time saver if you haven't experienced it yet — you don't need to remember the exact name of a setting, just tell the search bar what you are trying to do. Looking through your picture gallery should now be easier, just like how it has been with Google Photos for some years now.\\nIn general, not a bad update, but nothing huge even though it brings a redesign to the table.

Here's all you need to know.\\nMihai MateiReading time: 3 minutes\\nPhone\\nAs you may have noticed, the 2025 Galaxy A series showed up at the Samsung e-shop in several markets over the past few days. However, today, March 28, is officially the global launch day for the latest A-series trio. The Galaxy A26, Galaxy A36, and Galaxy A56 are now available worldwide, with some caveats.\\nThe one exception we can confirm is the USA. Earlier this month, Samsung revealed that the Galaxy A56 will be released in the USA “later this year,” and it is not yet available at the time of writing. On the other hand, the A26 and A36 went on sale stateside two days ago.\\nSo, with a few possible exceptions here and there, all three A-series phones are officially live globally. If you want to buy any of these devices, the best way to verify their availability in your region today is to hit up your local Samsung e-shop. Special offers will also vary by market.

This is a blanket term describing a set of clever features that will enhance your user experience.\\nYou can read more about Awesome Intelligence vs Galaxy AI here, but keep in mind that the feature list differs slightly from one Galaxy A phone to the other. The Galaxy A56 has the most Awesome Intelligence features.\\nThe Galaxy A26, Galaxy A36, and Galaxy A56 share the same design language, which revolves around a Key Island frame and a new oblong camera housing.\\nPricing will vary by region, but in most of Europe, the Galaxy A26, A36, and A56 start at €299, €379, and €479. In the UK, the phones cost £299, £399, and £499.

April is almost here, and Samsung has just two days to fulfill its promise of releasing One UI 7 Beta for the last eligible device.\\nSince the Galaxy A55 didn’t go on sale in the US, the Android 15-based One UI 7 Beta will remain a flagship offering. The Beta Program is live for the Galaxy S24 series in seven countries, while the Wave II devices are eligible in just four markets.\\nSimilar to the Galaxy S24 series, Android 15-based One UI 7 will be the first major upgrade for the Galaxy A55. It’s the only mid-range (non-flagship) Samsung device that is officially listed to enter the One UI 7 Beta Program.\\nEarlier, the company’s Indian subsidiary published a Beta noticeboard in the Members Community. It indicates that the preparations are underway but things may not go ahead as expected as Official rollout commencing on April 7.\\nSamsung indeed wants to run the One UI 7 Beta for the mid-range phone. However, it should be here in the next few days as the Stable rollout for smartphones like the Galaxy S24 series, the Z Flip 6, and Z Fold 6 could cause a delay.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe South Korean tech giant has just released the Galaxy A26, A36, and A56 globally. These new devices come pre-installed with the Android 15-based One UI 7.0. That said, the A55 users may have a brief One UI Beta testing program.\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nGalaxy S24’s Now Bar glitch in One UI 7 Beta: Live Google Sports Scores missing\\nPublished\\n7 hours agoon\\nMarch 29, 2025\\nBy\\nYash\\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series introduced Google Sports for Now Bar. With the recent One UI 7 Beta updates, Samsung expanded the Google Sports live scores feature to Now Bar on the Galaxy S24 and S23 series and the Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6.\\nWhile the One UI 7 Beta has added Google Sports to the Now Bar, the live scores are not updating on the Galaxy S24 series. The function exists in its relevant section within the One UI 7, but it’s not functional, as the live scores activity is broken.\\nIt has been found that the Google Sports is broken within the Discover feed. Despite following preferred teams for sports scores, the updates aren’t functioning.\\nAs Google Sports isn’t functional in Discover, Now Bar can’t show live updates. Samsung and Google may be aware of the cause, and a fix might be coming with the Stable build next month.\\nClearing the cache and app data won’t address the problem either. The bug renders you to wait until a fix comes through the One UI 7 Beta or Stable or an update to Google App.\\nAdvertisement\\nSamsung hasn’t yet acknowledged the problem, but the Stable update is set to arrive on April 7. Galaxy S24 series users may have live scores through the Now Bar once the update arrives.\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nGalaxy S23 gets revamped charging animation, new Now Bar features, and versatile Drawing Assist in latest One UI 7 Beta\\nPublished\\n9 hours agoon\\nMarch 29, 2025\\nBy\\nSheetal\\nSamsung Galaxy S23, Galaxy S23 Plus, and Galaxy S23 Ultra smartphones recently received the One UI 7 Beta 2 update, bringing new features and bug fixes to provide a smoother experience. Some of the highlighted upgraded functions in the latest One UI 7 Beta update for the Galaxy S23 include the charging animation, Now Bar, and Drawing Assist.\\nWith the latest beta update, users of the Galaxy S23 series can enjoy features similar to those of the Galaxy S25 series. However, the new features are already available to the Galaxy S24, Galaxy Z Flip 6, and Galaxy Z Fold 6 smartphones through the beta update. Let’s explore what Samsung brings with One UI 7 Beta for the charging animation, Now Bar, and Drawing Assist in the Galaxy S23 series.\\nNow Bar\\nThe latest update adds “Sports” from Google to the Live notification section of the Now Bar.

In a recent development, Samsung has provided the Best Face AI feature to Galaxy S24 and S23 users with the latest One UI 7 Beta update.\\nWith the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung introduced Best Face, with the feature now available on the Galaxy S24 and S23 series and the A56. Levaraging AI, the functionality allows you to fix an individual or group photo effortlessly.\\nYou may have encountered a big issue while taking group selfies or pictures. In a group photo, the face of an individual or more may lead you to capture another photo due to closed eyes, different view point angle or any odd aspect.\\nWell, you will no longer need to capture dozens of photos to get the best group shot.\\nBest Face\\nWhen enabled, Best Face displays improvements for faces in a group shot. You can pick the most preferred shot from the display once and apply the fix. It will swiftly apply the chosen face on the individual while keeping others intact.\\nAdvertisement\\nNotably, Best Face only shows suggestions when the picture is captured in Motion Photo mode. The shot taken as Motion Photo adapts a little longer scene than a fixed shot, which lets the Best Face display suggest leveraging AI.\\nTo use Best Face, open an image having the face of an individual or a group. Swipe up the way you access the Remaster and Object Eraser, and you get a new Best Face tool. Well, the photo must be a Motion photo otherwise, the option won’t appear.\\nContinue Reading\\nMost Popular\\n*\\nOne UI23 hours ago Samsung One UI 7 Stable Update: Everything you need to know about the major software update for your Galaxy *\\nWallpapers2 days ago Download Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Stock Wallpapers *\\nOne UI2 days ago User interest for One UI 7 overshadowed Android 15 and 16 *\\nOne UI2 days ago Samsung teases One UI 7 Beta for Galaxy A55 – Will Awesome Intelligence tag along?\\nAbout Us\\nContact Us\\nCopyright Policy\\nPrivacy Policy\\nCopyright © 2025 SammyFans.com\", \"title\": \"Samsung One UI 7 Beta: Everything you need to know - Sammy Fans\", \"score\": 0.13347194, \"published_date\": \"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 16:06:17 GMT\", \"content\": \"*   Samsung Galaxy A55 stuck without Android 15 One UI 7 Beta *   Galaxy S24’s Now Bar glitch in One UI 7 Beta: Live Google Sports Scores missing *   Galaxy S25 Ultra’s Expert RAW gears up for a bold upgrade [Gallery] *   Galaxy S23 gets revamped charging animation, new Now Bar features, and versatile Drawing Assist in latest One UI 7 Beta *   My Galaxy S25 lacks this Live Notification feature available in S24 and S23 *   Samsung One UI 7 Stable Update: Everything you need to know about the major software update for your Galaxy In a recent development, Samsung has provided the Best Face AI feature to Galaxy S24 and S23 users with the latest One UI 7 Beta update.\"}]\n",

Yes, the Galaxy S25 launched with it, but it’s been months now and owners of the super-premium Galaxy S24 Ultra, or the Galaxy Z Fold 6 haven’t gotten a taste of the new Samsung software.\\nApple has failed to provide the massive Siri update we were supposed to get with iOS 18.4, and Samsung may have a 7-year software update promise, but if it takes months to get the new stuff, users start getting irritated.\\nAt least it’s now been confirmed — older Galaxies will be getting One UI 7 on the 7th of April if you are outside the States. In the USA, you will get it on the 10th.\\nHere's what you should expect to see:\\nSlightly redesigned icons\\nNew widgets with multiple shapes and designs for the Samsung apps\\nA new, vertical app drawer (switches to horizontal if you select Custom sorting, but that's a pain)\\nNotifications and Quick Toggles now separated — swipe down from top-right for the quick panel\\nNow Bar - a persistent, active widget, like the Dynamic Island\\nUpdated AI select - the old Smart Select that resided in the Edge Panel is now branded AI select as it automatically suggests actions\\nCamera app facelift - moving the controls around to make it cleaner and one-hand friendly\\nAI search in Samsung Gallery and Settings (maybe not coming to S21?)\\nNow Brief - a quick summary of your day and suggested actions\\nFaster Circle to Search - now automatically suggests actions based on selected content (call number, compose to email address, et cetera)\\nGenerate unique stickers with AI - new AI key in the Samsung Emoji keyboard (maybe not coming to S21?)\\nReceive the latest Samsung news\\nSubscribe\\nBy subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.\\nSome visual elements of One UI 7 have been criticized for moving away from the Samsung look and style — like the new quick toggles menu, which kind of looks like an iPhone Control Center if you squint. However, the smart search in Settings will be a big time saver if you haven't experienced it yet — you don't need to remember the exact name of a setting, just tell the search bar what you are trying to do. Looking through your picture gallery should now be easier, just like how it has been with Google Photos for some years now.\\nIn general, not a bad update, but nothing huge even though it brings a redesign to the table.

And you can even make a phone call through the new washer and dryer.\\nby Jennifer Pattison Tuohy\\nMar 30, 2025, 2:00 AM UTC\\n2 Comments / 2 New\\nSamaung’s new Bespoke AI Jet Ultra cordless stick vacuum has an\\nAI cleaning mode that senses floor types and automatically adjusts suction power and brush speed.\\nImage: Samsung\\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy is a smart home reporter who’s been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News.\\nIn our notification-heavy world, there is still one activity where you might just miss that buzz on your phone or ping on your smartwatch – while you’re vacuuming. Thankfully, Samsung has a solution.\\nIts newest cordless stick vac, the new Bespoke AI Jet Ultra ($1,099), now has an LCD display control panel that, along with standard features such as power level and battery life, can notify you when you have an incoming phone call or text message. The vacuum, which works with an auto-empty charging station, also features 400AW suction and 100-minute battery life.\\nEven better, if you’re doing the wash and left your phone in the other room, Samsung’s added touchscreens to its washers and dryers, including the new Bespoke AI Laundry Vented Combo washer / dryer ($3,099). This lets you answer a call directly on the built-in 7-inch LCD screen. The Combo can also (perhaps more usefully) put detergent in for you automatically and then, when the cycle is done, open its door.\\nThe new Bespoke combo washer and dryer has several tech upgrades, including a new 7-inch touchscreen that you can make phone calls on.\\nImage: Samsung\\nThe company has been rolling out the ability to answer your phone from your appliance to its entire Bespoke AI line. At CES this year, Samsung showed off these AI Home control panels on several appliances, including its new Bespoke AI smart fridges and wall ovens. The features work with Android and iOS and require a Samsung account and the SmartThings app.\\nAI Home is a new terminology Samsung uses to refer to the 7- or 9-inch LCD screens on its products and the screens built into its flagship Family Hub smart fridge. The fridge now has the option of a slimmed-down screen that — like the other AI Home screens — includes music, weather, and cooking apps, and smart home controls.\\nOf course, you can still get the fridge with a giant 21.5-inch or 32-inch screen that can run even more apps, including Samsung TV and TikTok. These screens all also work as controls for the appliance and integrate with other Samsung appliances and services, sometimes using AI.\\nThe flagship Samsung Family Hub smart fridge now comes with the option of a smaller screen.\\nFor example, on the fridge screen, you can look up a recipe in the Samsung Food app using ingredients it has identified you have using its AI-powered cameras. You can then send the cooking instructions to your oven and use the screen to view the recipe. It’s like having your phone with you everywhere, except your hands are free.\\nThe AI Home screens can connect to Samsung’s SmartThings smart home platform. That means you can get alerts on your appliances about other events in your smart home, for example, you can see (and talk to) whoever is at your Ring video doorbell while unloading the washer.\\nSamsung’s “screens everywhere” approach is part of its AI for the home push, its vision of tech working in the background to help you with your daily life. While the smart home has plenty of potential to save you time, money, and energy, putting screens into everything feels like overkill. A smart display could serve much of the same purpose, and would probably cost less to replace than a cooktop when you drop a pan on its screen.\\nTech-heavy touchscreens built into appliances also feel susceptible to obsolescence, not to mention being more likely to malfunction than that plastic knob on your washing machine. The other concern about screens in the home is that they could be used to serve up ads, as is the case with Amazon’s Echo Show smart displays. While Samsung has not done this yet on its appliances, it’s an understandable worry. The Verge reached out to Samsung about these concerns and will follow up with the company’s response.\\n2 Comments / 2 New\\nSee More:\\nNews\\nSamsung\\nSmart Home\\nTech\\nMore in this stream\\nSee all\\nFirst Alert’s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacement\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 2823\\nGoogle discontinues Nest Protect smoke alarm and Nest x Yale door lock\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 2838\\nYale’s new smart lock can match your Google Nest doorbell\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 285\\nMost Popular\\nMost Popular\\nGoogle discontinues Nest Protect smoke alarm and Nest x Yale door lock\\nKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starter\\nWindows 11 is closing a loophole that let you skip making a Microsoft account\\nHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUs\\nMadison Square Garden’s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt design\\nInstaller\\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\\nEmail (required)\\nSign Up\\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Samsung and Google may be aware of the cause, and a fix might be coming with the Stable build next month.\\nClearing the cache and app data won’t address the problem either.

Some of the highlighted upgraded functions in the latest One UI 7 Beta update for the Galaxy S23 include the charging animation, Now Bar, and Drawing Assist.\\nWith the latest beta update, users of the Galaxy S23 series can enjoy features similar to those of the Galaxy S25 series. However, the new features are already available to the Galaxy S24, Galaxy Z Flip 6, and Galaxy Z Fold 6 smartphones through the beta update. Let’s explore what Samsung brings with One UI 7 Beta for the charging animation, Now Bar, and Drawing Assist in the Galaxy S23 series.\\nNow Bar\\nThe latest update adds “Sports” from Google to the Live notification section of the Now Bar. This means you can now check sports scores directly from the Status Bar, Notification Panel, and a Dynamic Island-inspired UI through Live Notification.\\nAlso, you can view sports scores on the lock screen, using the Now Bar pill. You can also notice that the ” Live Notification” option on the top has been changed to “Now Bar.”\\nAdvertisement\\nNew\\nOld\\nCharging Animation\\nOne UI 7 Beta 2 update revamped the charging animation on the Galaxy S23, similar to other flagships testing the beta update. The revamped charging animation removes the solid background overlay. It significantly improves the overall appearance of the charging indicator, making it smoother.\\nNew\\nOld\\nDrawing Assist\\nWith the new update, Drawing Assist is much more versatile on the Galaxy S23 series. Now, users can create images not just from sketches, but also using text descriptions or image prompts. This gives you more ways to create AI-generated artwork.\\nAdditionally, the AI ​​has become better at understanding more complex inputs, which means the results are likely to be more realistic and creative.\\nAdvertisement\\nNew\\nold\\nIf you’re using the latest beta version of the Galaxy S23 smartphone, check out the new upgrades to enjoy these features even more.\\nHow to enable Sports Score Now Bar in Samsung One UI 7\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nSamsung One UI 7 Stable Update: Everything you need to know about the major software update for your Galaxy\\nPublished\\n23 hours agoon\\nMarch 28, 2025\\nBy\\nRobin Williams\\nHey, Sammy Fans!

In a recent development, Samsung has provided the Best Face AI feature to Galaxy S24 and S23 users with the latest One UI 7 Beta update.\\nWith the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung introduced Best Face, with the feature now available on the Galaxy S24 and S23 series and the A56. Levaraging AI, the functionality allows you to fix an individual or group photo effortlessly.\\nYou may have encountered a big issue while taking group selfies or pictures. In a group photo, the face of an individual or more may lead you to capture another photo due to closed eyes, different view point angle or any odd aspect.\\nWell, you will no longer need to capture dozens of photos to get the best group shot.\\nBest Face\\nWhen enabled, Best Face displays improvements for faces in a group shot. You can pick the most preferred shot from the display once and apply the fix. It will swiftly apply the chosen face on the individual while keeping others intact.\\nAdvertisement\\nNotably, Best Face only shows suggestions when the picture is captured in Motion Photo mode. The shot taken as Motion Photo adapts a little longer scene than a fixed shot, which lets the Best Face display suggest leveraging AI.\\nTo use Best Face, open an image having the face of an individual or a group. Swipe up the way you access the Remaster and Object Eraser, and you get a new Best Face tool. Well, the photo must be a Motion photo otherwise, the option won’t appear.\\nContinue Reading\\nMost Popular\\n*\\nOne UI23 hours ago Samsung One UI 7 Stable Update: Everything you need to know about the major software update for your Galaxy *\\nWallpapers2 days ago Download Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Stock Wallpapers *\\nOne UI2 days ago User interest for One UI 7 overshadowed Android 15 and 16 *\\nOne UI2 days ago Samsung teases One UI 7 Beta for Galaxy A55 – Will Awesome Intelligence tag along?\\nAbout Us\\nContact Us\\nCopyright Policy\\nPrivacy Policy\\nCopyright © 2025 SammyFans.com\", \"title\": \"Samsung One UI 7 Beta: Everything you need to know - Sammy Fans\", \"score\": 0.094218515, \"published_date\": \"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 16:06:17 GMT\", \"content\": \"*   Samsung Galaxy A55 stuck without Android 15 One UI 7 Beta *   Galaxy S24’s Now Bar glitch in One UI 7 Beta: Live Google Sports Scores missing *   Galaxy S25 Ultra’s Expert RAW gears up for a bold upgrade [Gallery] *   Galaxy S23 gets revamped charging animation, new Now Bar features, and versatile Drawing Assist in latest One UI 7 Beta *   My Galaxy S25 lacks this Live Notification feature available in S24 and S23 *   Samsung One UI 7 Stable Update: Everything you need to know about the major software update for your Galaxy In a recent development, Samsung has provided the Best Face AI feature to Galaxy S24 and S23 users with the latest One UI 7 Beta update.\"}, {\"url\": \"https://www.theverge.com/news/639078/samsung-bespoke-ai-jet-ultra-vacuum-text-messages\", \"raw_content\": \"Published Time: 2025-03-30T02:00:00+00:00\\nSamsung’s latest smart appliances are all about the screens. | The Verge\\nSkip to main content\\nThe homepage\\nSubscribeSign In\\n*\\nTech\\n*\\nReviews\\n*\\nScience\\n*\\nEntertainment\\n*\\nAI\\n*\\nMore\\nThe homepage\\nMenu\\nNavigation Drawer\\nLogin\\n/\\nSign Up\\nclose\\nSearch\\nTech\\nAll Tech\\nAmazon\\nApple\\nFacebook\\nGoogle\\nMicrosoft\\nSamsung\\nBusiness\\nCreators\\nMobile\\nPolicy\\nSecurity\\nTransportation\\nReviews\\nAll Reviews\\nBuying Guides\\nDeals\\nGift Guide\\nLaptops\\nPhones\\nHeadphones\\nTablets\\nSmart Home\\nSmartwatches\\nSpeakers\\nDrones\\nScience\\nAll Science\\nSpace\\nEnergy\\nEnvironment\\nHealth\\nCOVID-19\\nEntertainment\\nAll Entertainment\\nGames\\nTV Shows\\nMovies\\nAudio\\nAI\\nCars\\nAll Cars\\nElectric Cars\\nAutonomous Cars\\nRide-Sharing\\nScooters\\nOther Transportation\\nFeatures\\nVideos\\nAll Videos\\nYouTube\\nTikTok\\nInstagram\\nPodcasts\\nAll Podcasts\\nDecoder\\nThe Vergecast\\nNewsletters\\nAll Newsletters\\nCommand Line\\nInstaller\\nNotepad\\nVerge Deals\\nStore\\nSubscribe\\nSamsung’s latest stick vac can alert you to calls and text messages\\n2\\nComments Drawer\\nNews\\nSamsung’s latest stick vac can alert you to calls and text messages\\nThe Bespoke Jet AI now comes with an LCD display that connects to your phone to show incoming calls and texts.

And you can even make a phone call through the new washer and dryer.\\nby Jennifer Pattison Tuohy\\nMar 30, 2025, 2:00 AM UTC\\n2 Comments / 2 New\\nSamaung’s new Bespoke AI Jet Ultra cordless stick vacuum has an\\nAI cleaning mode that senses floor types and automatically adjusts suction power and brush speed.\\nImage: Samsung\\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy is a smart home reporter who’s been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News.\\nIn our notification-heavy world, there is still one activity where you might just miss that buzz on your phone or ping on your smartwatch – while you’re vacuuming. Thankfully, Samsung has a solution.\\nIts newest cordless stick vac, the new Bespoke AI Jet Ultra ($1,099), now has an LCD display control panel that, along with standard features such as power level and battery life, can notify you when you have an incoming phone call or text message. The vacuum, which works with an auto-empty charging station, also features 400AW suction and 100-minute battery life.\\nEven better, if you’re doing the wash and left your phone in the other room, Samsung’s added touchscreens to its washers and dryers, including the new Bespoke AI Laundry Vented Combo washer / dryer ($3,099). This lets you answer a call directly on the built-in 7-inch LCD screen. The Combo can also (perhaps more usefully) put detergent in for you automatically and then, when the cycle is done, open its door.\\nThe new Bespoke combo washer and dryer has several tech upgrades, including a new 7-inch touchscreen that you can make phone calls on.\\nImage: Samsung\\nThe company has been rolling out the ability to answer your phone from your appliance to its entire Bespoke AI line. At CES this year, Samsung showed off these AI Home control panels on several appliances, including its new Bespoke AI smart fridges and wall ovens. The features work with Android and iOS and require a Samsung account and the SmartThings app.\\nAI Home is a new terminology Samsung uses to refer to the 7- or 9-inch LCD screens on its products and the screens built into its flagship Family Hub smart fridge. The fridge now has the option of a slimmed-down screen that — like the other AI Home screens — includes music, weather, and cooking apps, and smart home controls.\\nOf course, you can still get the fridge with a giant 21.5-inch or 32-inch screen that can run even more apps, including Samsung TV and TikTok. These screens all also work as controls for the appliance and integrate with other Samsung appliances and services, sometimes using AI.\\nThe flagship Samsung Family Hub smart fridge now comes with the option of a smaller screen.\\nFor example, on the fridge screen, you can look up a recipe in the Samsung Food app using ingredients it has identified you have using its AI-powered cameras. You can then send the cooking instructions to your oven and use the screen to view the recipe. It’s like having your phone with you everywhere, except your hands are free.\\nThe AI Home screens can connect to Samsung’s SmartThings smart home platform. That means you can get alerts on your appliances about other events in your smart home, for example, you can see (and talk to) whoever is at your Ring video doorbell while unloading the washer.\\nSamsung’s “screens everywhere” approach is part of its AI for the home push, its vision of tech working in the background to help you with your daily life. While the smart home has plenty of potential to save you time, money, and energy, putting screens into everything feels like overkill. A smart display could serve much of the same purpose, and would probably cost less to replace than a cooktop when you drop a pan on its screen.\\nTech-heavy touchscreens built into appliances also feel susceptible to obsolescence, not to mention being more likely to malfunction than that plastic knob on your washing machine. The other concern about screens in the home is that they could be used to serve up ads, as is the case with Amazon’s Echo Show smart displays. While Samsung has not done this yet on its appliances, it’s an understandable worry. The Verge reached out to Samsung about these concerns and will follow up with the company’s response.\\n2 Comments / 2 New\\nSee More:\\nNews\\nSamsung\\nSmart Home\\nTech\\nMore in this stream\\nSee all\\nFirst Alert’s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacement\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 2823\\nGoogle discontinues Nest Protect smoke alarm and Nest x Yale door lock\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 2838\\nYale’s new smart lock can match your Google Nest doorbell\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 285\\nMost Popular\\nMost Popular\\nGoogle discontinues Nest Protect smoke alarm and Nest x Yale door lock\\nKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starter\\nWindows 11 is closing a loophole that let you skip making a Microsoft account\\nHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUs\\nMadison Square Garden’s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt design\\nInstaller\\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\\nEmail (required)\\nSign Up\\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

A spokesperson for Columbia declined to comment on individual students.\\nChungin “Roy” Lee, 21, has been using social media to document the consequences of using AI to cheat on his internship interviews.Courtesy Roy Lee\\nSavewith a NBCUniversal Profile\\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\\nMarch 27, 2025, 9:51 PM UTC\\nBy Angela Yang\\nA computer science student at Columbia University said he has been kicked out by the school after he built an artificial intelligence tool to cheat in tech job interviews and documented the fallout online.\\nChungin “Roy” Lee, a second-year undergraduate, garnered online attention after he claimed to have fooled four of the world’s biggest companies using Interview Coder, a desktop app he created to discreetly solve technical coding questions.\\nIn a now-removed YouTube video, Lee 21, recorded himself using the tool during an internship interview with Amazon. His app, which he said took only four days to build, allows users to take screenshots of problems without being detected by their browsers. It then processes the images using AI to spit out solutions in real time.\\nRoy Lee uploaded a now-deleted video to YouTube showcasing how he used Interview Coder during an interview with Amazon.Courtesy Roy Lee\\nIt was a stunt that highlighted the proliferation of generative AI technology in everything from schoolwork to technical jobs, as users discover new tools to help them cover for their lack of skill or knowledge or to otherwise enhance their abilities. As such tools advance, schools and workplaces have struggled to accurately detect their use.“I think 99% people probably haven’t realized how far-reaching this could be,” Lee told NBC News. “In the past, you could have built an invisible desktop assistant, and you also could have used LLMs [large language models] to solve problems. But now that people are putting the two together, I think no form of online assessment is safe.”\\nLee, who is in New York City, said he got the internship offer from Amazon this year. In February, he went online to broadcast that he “used AI to pass my Amazon Interview.” (The video got about 100,000 views before YouTube removed it, citing a copyright claim by Amazon.)\\nLee claims he used Interview Coder to nab offers from all four of the companies he tested it on: Amazon, Capital One, Meta and TikTok. He said that he rejected Amazon’s offer and that several of the other companies rescinded their offers after he publicly posted about his use of AI.\\nRecommended\\nImmigration\\nImmigrationHow a TikTok network spreading Spanish-language immigration misinformation gained traction\\nSecurity\\nSecurityHow the Signal app used in text group can leave the door open for spies and hackers\\nAs a result of his publicized stunt, Columbia University ushered Lee through a disciplinary process that resulted in a yearlong suspension, he said. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment on individual students, citing Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act regulations.\\nMargaret Callahan, a spokesperson for Amazon, said that while the company welcomes candidates’ sharing their experiences working with generative AI tools when it’s relevant to the roles they’re applying for, they must also acknowledge that they won’t use unauthorized tools — such as generative AI technology — to help them during the interview or assessment process.\\nCapital One, Meta and TikTok didn’t respond to requests for comment.\\nSince he began documenting his journey on social media roughly a month ago, Lee said, Interview Coder has had user growth of 50% week over week, and it’s now making $170,000 in monthly subscriptions.\\nHe has continued building his brand online as a combative rule breaker by posting what he claims to be emails with recruiters and documents from his subsequent disciplinary process with Columbia. He has gained more than 43,000 new followers on X, where he has seen the most support for his stunt. On LinkedIn, where he has also gained about new 11,000 followers, the reactions have been more mixed, with some users calling his product “morally unethical” or “corrupt.”\\nRoy Lee says he's not worried about burning bridges and has no plans to return to Columbia after his suspension.Roy Lee\\nLee said he’s “not really worried about burning bridges” within the academic and corporate worlds at the start of his career, as he prefers to invest in entrepreneurship.\\nTrolling the companies, he said, was an act of protest against what he perceives as their overreliance on LeetCode, a popular online platform that provides preparatory questions for coding interviews.\\n“I was in the top 2% of global LeetCode users, and this was probably, like, the 600 most miserable hours of my life when programming,” Lee said. “The questions are not indicative of what you do in the real world. They’re riddles that you have to memorize.”\\nOther AI-powered interview cheating apps, such as Leetcode Wizard, which touts successful results for thousands of users, have also become increasingly popular during the generative AI boom of recent years.\\nSome of them specifically tap into what many software engineers have expressed as a growing disillusionment with LeetCode.\\nLeetCode “doesn’t properly allow engineers to demonstrate their abilities when it comes to programming, while also ignoring the use of AI in daily programming work,” Isabel de Vries, Leetcode Wizard’s head of marketing, said in a statement. “It’s understandable that candidates would want to use similar tools during their interviews.”\\nLee said he knew posting his Amazon interview would be a “really visual, viral way” to tackle the issue that motivated him to create Interview Coder in the first place.

Now that tools like his are rising in use and popularity, the genie can’t be put back in the bottle.\\n“I think cheating on these online assessment interviews is really much more common than people think,” Lee said. “Many CS students who are pretty serious about recruiting and stuff know that there are apps like this.

And you can even make a phone call through the new washer and dryer.\\nby Jennifer Pattison Tuohy\\nMar 30, 2025, 2:00 AM UTC\\n2 Comments / 2 New\\nSamaung’s new Bespoke AI Jet Ultra cordless stick vacuum has an\\nAI cleaning mode that senses floor types and automatically adjusts suction power and brush speed.\\nImage: Samsung\\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy is a smart home reporter who’s been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News.\\nIn our notification-heavy world, there is still one activity where you might just miss that buzz on your phone or ping on your smartwatch – while you’re vacuuming. Thankfully, Samsung has a solution.\\nIts newest cordless stick vac, the new Bespoke AI Jet Ultra ($1,099), now has an LCD display control panel that, along with standard features such as power level and battery life, can notify you when you have an incoming phone call or text message. The vacuum, which works with an auto-empty charging station, also features 400AW suction and 100-minute battery life.\\nEven better, if you’re doing the wash and left your phone in the other room, Samsung’s added touchscreens to its washers and dryers, including the new Bespoke AI Laundry Vented Combo washer / dryer ($3,099). This lets you answer a call directly on the built-in 7-inch LCD screen. The Combo can also (perhaps more usefully) put detergent in for you automatically and then, when the cycle is done, open its door.\\nThe new Bespoke combo washer and dryer has several tech upgrades, including a new 7-inch touchscreen that you can make phone calls on.\\nImage: Samsung\\nThe company has been rolling out the ability to answer your phone from your appliance to its entire Bespoke AI line. At CES this year, Samsung showed off these AI Home control panels on several appliances, including its new Bespoke AI smart fridges and wall ovens. The features work with Android and iOS and require a Samsung account and the SmartThings app.\\nAI Home is a new terminology Samsung uses to refer to the 7- or 9-inch LCD screens on its products and the screens built into its flagship Family Hub smart fridge. The fridge now has the option of a slimmed-down screen that — like the other AI Home screens — includes music, weather, and cooking apps, and smart home controls.\\nOf course, you can still get the fridge with a giant 21.5-inch or 32-inch screen that can run even more apps, including Samsung TV and TikTok. These screens all also work as controls for the appliance and integrate with other Samsung appliances and services, sometimes using AI.\\nThe flagship Samsung Family Hub smart fridge now comes with the option of a smaller screen.\\nFor example, on the fridge screen, you can look up a recipe in the Samsung Food app using ingredients it has identified you have using its AI-powered cameras. You can then send the cooking instructions to your oven and use the screen to view the recipe. It’s like having your phone with you everywhere, except your hands are free.\\nThe AI Home screens can connect to Samsung’s SmartThings smart home platform. That means you can get alerts on your appliances about other events in your smart home, for example, you can see (and talk to) whoever is at your Ring video doorbell while unloading the washer.\\nSamsung’s “screens everywhere” approach is part of its AI for the home push, its vision of tech working in the background to help you with your daily life. While the smart home has plenty of potential to save you time, money, and energy, putting screens into everything feels like overkill. A smart display could serve much of the same purpose, and would probably cost less to replace than a cooktop when you drop a pan on its screen.\\nTech-heavy touchscreens built into appliances also feel susceptible to obsolescence, not to mention being more likely to malfunction than that plastic knob on your washing machine. The other concern about screens in the home is that they could be used to serve up ads, as is the case with Amazon’s Echo Show smart displays. While Samsung has not done this yet on its appliances, it’s an understandable worry. The Verge reached out to Samsung about these concerns and will follow up with the company’s response.\\n2 Comments / 2 New\\nSee More:\\nNews\\nSamsung\\nSmart Home\\nTech\\nMore in this stream\\nSee all\\nFirst Alert’s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacement\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 2823\\nGoogle discontinues Nest Protect smoke alarm and Nest x Yale door lock\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 2838\\nYale’s new smart lock can match your Google Nest doorbell\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 285\\nMost Popular\\nMost Popular\\nGoogle discontinues Nest Protect smoke alarm and Nest x Yale door lock\\nKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starter\\nWindows 11 is closing a loophole that let you skip making a Microsoft account\\nHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUs\\nMadison Square Garden’s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt design\\nInstaller\\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\\nEmail (required)\\nSign Up\\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

April is almost here, and Samsung has just two days to fulfill its promise of releasing One UI 7 Beta for the last eligible device.\\nSince the Galaxy A55 didn’t go on sale in the US, the Android 15-based One UI 7 Beta will remain a flagship offering. The Beta Program is live for the Galaxy S24 series in seven countries, while the Wave II devices are eligible in just four markets.\\nSimilar to the Galaxy S24 series, Android 15-based One UI 7 will be the first major upgrade for the Galaxy A55. It’s the only mid-range (non-flagship) Samsung device that is officially listed to enter the One UI 7 Beta Program.\\nEarlier, the company’s Indian subsidiary published a Beta noticeboard in the Members Community. It indicates that the preparations are underway but things may not go ahead as expected as Official rollout commencing on April 7.\\nSamsung indeed wants to run the One UI 7 Beta for the mid-range phone. However, it should be here in the next few days as the Stable rollout for smartphones like the Galaxy S24 series, the Z Flip 6, and Z Fold 6 could cause a delay.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe South Korean tech giant has just released the Galaxy A26, A36, and A56 globally. These new devices come pre-installed with the Android 15-based One UI 7.0. That said, the A55 users may have a brief One UI Beta testing program.\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nGalaxy S24’s Now Bar glitch in One UI 7 Beta: Live Google Sports Scores missing\\nPublished\\n7 hours agoon\\nMarch 29, 2025\\nBy\\nYash\\nSamsung Galaxy S25 series introduced Google Sports for Now Bar. With the recent One UI 7 Beta updates, Samsung expanded the Google Sports live scores feature to Now Bar on the Galaxy S24 and S23 series and the Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6.\\nWhile the One UI 7 Beta has added Google Sports to the Now Bar, the live scores are not updating on the Galaxy S24 series. The function exists in its relevant section within the One UI 7, but it’s not functional, as the live scores activity is broken.\\nIt has been found that the Google Sports is broken within the Discover feed. Despite following preferred teams for sports scores, the updates aren’t functioning.\\nAs Google Sports isn’t functional in Discover, Now Bar can’t show live updates. Samsung and Google may be aware of the cause, and a fix might be coming with the Stable build next month.\\nClearing the cache and app data won’t address the problem either. The bug renders you to wait until a fix comes through the One UI 7 Beta or Stable or an update to Google App.\\nAdvertisement\\nSamsung hasn’t yet acknowledged the problem, but the Stable update is set to arrive on April 7. Galaxy S24 series users may have live scores through the Now Bar once the update arrives.\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nGalaxy S23 gets revamped charging animation, new Now Bar features, and versatile Drawing Assist in latest One UI 7 Beta\\nPublished\\n9 hours agoon\\nMarch 29, 2025\\nBy\\nSheetal\\nSamsung Galaxy S23, Galaxy S23 Plus, and Galaxy S23 Ultra smartphones recently received the One UI 7 Beta 2 update, bringing new features and bug fixes to provide a smoother experience. Some of the highlighted upgraded functions in the latest One UI 7 Beta update for the Galaxy S23 include the charging animation, Now Bar, and Drawing Assist.\\nWith the latest beta update, users of the Galaxy S23 series can enjoy features similar to those of the Galaxy S25 series. However, the new features are already available to the Galaxy S24, Galaxy Z Flip 6, and Galaxy Z Fold 6 smartphones through the beta update. Let’s explore what Samsung brings with One UI 7 Beta for the charging animation, Now Bar, and Drawing Assist in the Galaxy S23 series.\\nNow Bar\\nThe latest update adds “Sports” from Google to the Live notification section of the Now Bar. This means you can now check sports scores directly from the Status Bar, Notification Panel, and a Dynamic Island-inspired UI through Live Notification.\\nAlso, you can view sports scores on the lock screen, using the Now Bar pill. You can also notice that the ” Live Notification” option on the top has been changed to “Now Bar.”\\nAdvertisement\\nNew\\nOld\\nCharging Animation\\nOne UI 7 Beta 2 update revamped the charging animation on the Galaxy S23, similar to other flagships testing the beta update. The revamped charging animation removes the solid background overlay.

In a recent development, Samsung has provided the Best Face AI feature to Galaxy S24 and S23 users with the latest One UI 7 Beta update.\\nWith the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung introduced Best Face, with the feature now available on the Galaxy S24 and S23 series and the A56. Levaraging AI, the functionality allows you to fix an individual or group photo effortlessly.\\nYou may have encountered a big issue while taking group selfies or pictures. In a group photo, the face of an individual or more may lead you to capture another photo due to closed eyes, different view point angle or any odd aspect.\\nWell, you will no longer need to capture dozens of photos to get the best group shot.\\nBest Face\\nWhen enabled, Best Face displays improvements for faces in a group shot. You can pick the most preferred shot from the display once and apply the fix. It will swiftly apply the chosen face on the individual while keeping others intact.\\nAdvertisement\\nNotably, Best Face only shows suggestions when the picture is captured in Motion Photo mode. The shot taken as Motion Photo adapts a little longer scene than a fixed shot, which lets the Best Face display suggest leveraging AI.\\nTo use Best Face, open an image having the face of an individual or a group. Swipe up the way you access the Remaster and Object Eraser, and you get a new Best Face tool. Well, the photo must be a Motion photo otherwise, the option won’t appear.\\nContinue Reading\\nMost Popular\\n*\\nOne UI23 hours ago Samsung One UI 7 Stable Update: Everything you need to know about the major software update for your Galaxy *\\nWallpapers2 days ago Download Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Stock Wallpapers *\\nOne UI2 days ago User interest for One UI 7 overshadowed Android 15 and 16 *\\nOne UI2 days ago Samsung teases One UI 7 Beta for Galaxy A55 – Will Awesome Intelligence tag along?\\nAbout Us\\nContact Us\\nCopyright Policy\\nPrivacy Policy\\nCopyright © 2025 SammyFans.com\", \"title\": \"Samsung One UI 7 Beta: Everything you need to know - Sammy Fans\", \"score\": 0.08146875, \"published_date\": \"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 16:06:17 GMT\", \"content\": \"*   Samsung Galaxy A55 stuck without Android 15 One UI 7 Beta *   Galaxy S24’s Now Bar glitch in One UI 7 Beta: Live Google Sports Scores missing *   Galaxy S25 Ultra’s Expert RAW gears up for a bold upgrade [Gallery] *   Galaxy S23 gets revamped charging animation, new Now Bar features, and versatile Drawing Assist in latest One UI 7 Beta *   My Galaxy S25 lacks this Live Notification feature available in S24 and S23 *   Samsung One UI 7 Stable Update: Everything you need to know about the major software update for your Galaxy In a recent development, Samsung has provided the Best Face AI feature to Galaxy S24 and S23 users with the latest One UI 7 Beta update.\"}, {\"url\": \"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/columbia-university-student-trolls-big-tech-ai-tool-job-applications-rcna198454\", \"raw_content\": \"Published Time: 2025-03-27T21:51:33.507Z\\nKicked out of Columbia, this student doesn’t plan to stop trolling big tech with AI\\nIE 11 is not supported.

A spokesperson for Columbia declined to comment on individual students.\\nChungin “Roy” Lee, 21, has been using social media to document the consequences of using AI to cheat on his internship interviews.Courtesy Roy Lee\\nSavewith a NBCUniversal Profile\\nCreate your free profile or log in to save this article\\nMarch 27, 2025, 9:51 PM UTC\\nBy Angela Yang\\nA computer science student at Columbia University said he has been kicked out by the school after he built an artificial intelligence tool to cheat in tech job interviews and documented the fallout online.\\nChungin “Roy” Lee, a second-year undergraduate, garnered online attention after he claimed to have fooled four of the world’s biggest companies using Interview Coder, a desktop app he created to discreetly solve technical coding questions.\\nIn a now-removed YouTube video, Lee 21, recorded himself using the tool during an internship interview with Amazon. His app, which he said took only four days to build, allows users to take screenshots of problems without being detected by their browsers. It then processes the images using AI to spit out solutions in real time.\\nRoy Lee uploaded a now-deleted video to YouTube showcasing how he used Interview Coder during an interview with Amazon.Courtesy Roy Lee\\nIt was a stunt that highlighted the proliferation of generative AI technology in everything from schoolwork to technical jobs, as users discover new tools to help them cover for their lack of skill or knowledge or to otherwise enhance their abilities. As such tools advance, schools and workplaces have struggled to accurately detect their use.“I think 99% people probably haven’t realized how far-reaching this could be,” Lee told NBC News. “In the past, you could have built an invisible desktop assistant, and you also could have used LLMs [large language models] to solve problems. But now that people are putting the two together, I think no form of online assessment is safe.”\\nLee, who is in New York City, said he got the internship offer from Amazon this year. In February, he went online to broadcast that he “used AI to pass my Amazon Interview.” (The video got about 100,000 views before YouTube removed it, citing a copyright claim by Amazon.)\\nLee claims he used Interview Coder to nab offers from all four of the companies he tested it on: Amazon, Capital One, Meta and TikTok. He said that he rejected Amazon’s offer and that several of the other companies rescinded their offers after he publicly posted about his use of AI.\\nRecommended\\nImmigration\\nImmigrationHow a TikTok network spreading Spanish-language immigration misinformation gained traction\\nSecurity\\nSecurityHow the Signal app used in text group can leave the door open for spies and hackers\\nAs a result of his publicized stunt, Columbia University ushered Lee through a disciplinary process that resulted in a yearlong suspension, he said. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment on individual students, citing Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act regulations.\\nMargaret Callahan, a spokesperson for Amazon, said that while the company welcomes candidates’ sharing their experiences working with generative AI tools when it’s relevant to the roles they’re applying for, they must also acknowledge that they won’t use unauthorized tools — such as generative AI technology — to help them during the interview or assessment process.\\nCapital One, Meta and TikTok didn’t respond to requests for comment.\\nSince he began documenting his journey on social media roughly a month ago, Lee said, Interview Coder has had user growth of 50% week over week, and it’s now making $170,000 in monthly subscriptions.\\nHe has continued building his brand online as a combative rule breaker by posting what he claims to be emails with recruiters and documents from his subsequent disciplinary process with Columbia. He has gained more than 43,000 new followers on X, where he has seen the most support for his stunt. On LinkedIn, where he has also gained about new 11,000 followers, the reactions have been more mixed, with some users calling his product “morally unethical” or “corrupt.”\\nRoy Lee says he's not worried about burning bridges and has no plans to return to Columbia after his suspension.Roy Lee\\nLee said he’s “not really worried about burning bridges” within the academic and corporate worlds at the start of his career, as he prefers to invest in entrepreneurship.\\nTrolling the companies, he said, was an act of protest against what he perceives as their overreliance on LeetCode, a popular online platform that provides preparatory questions for coding interviews.\\n“I was in the top 2% of global LeetCode users, and this was probably, like, the 600 most miserable hours of my life when programming,” Lee said. “The questions are not indicative of what you do in the real world. They’re riddles that you have to memorize.”\\nOther AI-powered interview cheating apps, such as Leetcode Wizard, which touts successful results for thousands of users, have also become increasingly popular during the generative AI boom of recent years.\\nSome of them specifically tap into what many software engineers have expressed as a growing disillusionment with LeetCode.\\nLeetCode “doesn’t properly allow engineers to demonstrate their abilities when it comes to programming, while also ignoring the use of AI in daily programming work,” Isabel de Vries, Leetcode Wizard’s head of marketing, said in a statement. “It’s understandable that candidates would want to use similar tools during their interviews.”\\nLee said he knew posting his Amazon interview would be a “really visual, viral way” to tackle the issue that motivated him to create Interview Coder in the first place. He said success would mean getting big tech companies to change their interview formats. Now that tools like his are rising in use and popularity, the genie can’t be put back in the bottle.\\n“I think cheating on these online assessment interviews is really much more common than people think,” Lee said. “Many CS students who are pretty serious about recruiting and stuff know that there are apps like this. It’s just not understood at a large scale.”\\nAngela Yang\\nAngela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.\\nAbout\\nContact\\nHelp\\nCareers\\nAd Choices\\nPrivacy Policy\\nYour Privacy Choices\\nCA Notice\\nTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)\\nNBC News Sitemap\\nClosed Captioning\\nAdvertise\\nSelect Shopping\\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC\\n![Image 10](https://tag.researchnow.com/t/beacon?adn=13&ca=direct&pl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Ftech%2Ftech-news%2Fcolumbia-university-student-trolls-big-tech-ai-tool-job-applications-rcna198454&pr=284801&si=NBCNEWS)\\nResidents of one of the states listed in the ‘Your Rights’ section of NBCUniversal’s Privacy Policy we have received your Global Privacy Control signal or you have opted out from the toggle below, but there is another step.

In a recent development, Samsung has provided the Best Face AI feature to Galaxy S24 and S23 users with the latest One UI 7 Beta update.\\nWith the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung introduced Best Face, with the feature now available on the Galaxy S24 and S23 series and the A56. Levaraging AI, the functionality allows you to fix an individual or group photo effortlessly.\\nYou may have encountered a big issue while taking group selfies or pictures. In a group photo, the face of an individual or more may lead you to capture another photo due to closed eyes, different view point angle or any odd aspect.\\nWell, you will no longer need to capture dozens of photos to get the best group shot.\\nBest Face\\nWhen enabled, Best Face displays improvements for faces in a group shot. You can pick the most preferred shot from the display once and apply the fix. It will swiftly apply the chosen face on the individual while keeping others intact.\\nAdvertisement\\nNotably, Best Face only shows suggestions when the picture is captured in Motion Photo mode. The shot taken as Motion Photo adapts a little longer scene than a fixed shot, which lets the Best Face display suggest leveraging AI.\\nTo use Best Face, open an image having the face of an individual or a group. Swipe up the way you access the Remaster and Object Eraser, and you get a new Best Face tool. Well, the photo must be a Motion photo otherwise, the option won’t appear.\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nSamsung’s One UI Home crashes on Galaxy S23 after One UI 7 Beta 2 – Gemini Live at fault?\\nPublished\\n21 hours agoon\\nMarch 28, 2025\\nBy\\nYash\\nUsers of the Galaxy S23 series have upgraded to One UI 7 Beta 2. The update brings at least four new features and system improvements. Meanwhile, Gemini Live is causing One UI Home to crash on the Galaxy S23 series running One UI 7 Beta 2.\\nSamsung’s system launcher for home keeps crashing on the Galaxy S23 series with One UI 7 Beta 2, probably due to Gemini Live. It seems the new Google Assistant isn’t accurately optimized for the Galaxy S23 series, causing crash problems.\\nUsers of the Galaxy S23 series report that the home screen renders useless and then a crashing notice appears. The said notice allows the user to either wait for the system to respond or end the task to immediately resolve the problem.\\nNotably, users are able to reproduce the glitch. It happens when you open Gemini Live and then trigger the Live Notifications. As soon as you land on the home screen, the problem will appear, making the screen useless until the crash notice appears.\\nSince the issue is causing under Beta Program, it isn’t a big deal. As many users spotted the same problem, Samsung will address it in the next Beta update. There might also be a Beta 2 Hotfix to resolve the crashing issue quickly.\\nAdvertisement\\nApart from this, the home screen has another issue related to the Large Folders feature. The folder popup lacks a blur background, which reduces the uniformity of the software. A similar issue was spotted on the Galaxy S24’s One UI 7 Beta earlier.\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nUser interest for One UI 7 overshadowed Android 15 and 16\\nPublished\\n1 day agoon\\nMarch 27, 2025\\nBy\\nChanakya Shrutam\\nWeb searches for One UI 7 have increased on the internet for the past two months and already surpassed Android 15 and the upcoming version simultaneously in terms of users’ interest.\\nAndroid is the world’s largest mobile operating system, making an ecosystem of hundreds of companies, and Samsung has a unique role in popularizing Google’s OS with its vast device range.\\nIn the past five years, Samsung has deepened Android ecosystem’s integration in One UI. For example, it dropped some of the home-grown Google apps and service alternatives to act ‘more’ like an Android.\\nDespite an Android base, One UI 7 has gained massive popularity, which didn’t happen before, and here we’ll explore the possible reasons for this new development.\\nNew Upgrades\\nSamsung unveiled One UI 7 with major upgrades in animations, user interface and operational fluency. The software experience is much better than it predecessor, which is captivating for existing smartphone owners.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe beta program started with the Galaxy S24 series, 2024’s flagship phones, which triggered global media coverage about One UI 7 beta. The users were excited about new additions, revealed by early beta testers, generating excitement.\\nS25\\nThe real One UI 7 hype began with the Galaxy S25 series launch in mid-January. This new flagship was the first to pack with a stable software and a couple of additional features that weren’t even available for beta testers at that time.\\nThis year, Samsung majorly focused its launch event on the software and AI features compared and less on the hardware.\\nAgain, the majority of the media covered the Galaxy S25 series’ software side, making it even more compelling to the previous flagship users.\\nRollout delay\\nOne UI 7 is a big update, but its rollout delay is quite unsatisfying. The majority of Galaxy users weren’t aware of the One UI 7 (Android 15) rollout. This release suspense has garnered a mass internet search about eligible devices and release date.\\nAdvertisement\\nThis trend remained the same after the S25 release and picked up pace with every rumor and leak about this software’ release. On March 18, an official press-release finally unraveled Samsung’s April plan for One UI 7, ending this long-standing mystery.\\nSearch Trends\\nSince early December, I’ve seen tons of online articles about this new update. I also take a look at the Google Trends search volume from December 1, 2024, to March 25, 2025.\\nIt shows that One UI 7’s search volume is on par with Android 15, but its search interest is above both Android versions.\\nIt’s not about competition between Samsung and Google, instead, the search reflects the higher user interest in Samsung’s software technologies.\\nThis is also good for Google in terms of partnership with Samsung and promoting new capabilities such as Gemini and circle to search in Galaxy devices.\\nAdvertisement\\nStill, Samsung needs to work on its rollout efficiency to delivery software updates on time.\\nSource – Google Trends\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nOne UI 7 Beta 2 update live for Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, Tab S10 Ultra\\nPublished\\n2 days agoon\\nMarch 27, 2025\\nBy\\nSheetal\\nSamsung has pushed the One UI 7 Beta 2 update for Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra devices. The update is currently available in Korea, and the company will soon expand it to more countries.\\nThe new Beta update fixes Home-related issues to provide better Home screen functions. It also improves Bluetooth-related issues that users encountered in the previous beta.\\nMoreover, it resolves several minor issues that affect the Galaxy Tab S10 series’ performance. Aside from this, the screen ratio adjustment is officially applied as a display.\\nOne UI 7 Beta 2 update for Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra can be identified via One UI build versions ending with ZYC5. Users of these devices will have to download around 1.06 GB package to install the update.\\nThe update does not bring any new features for the Galaxy Tab S10 series, but it enhances some functions for a smoother experience. It installs the March 2025 security patch to improve system security and stability.\\nAdvertisement\\nIf you are testing Beta on your Galaxy Tab S10 Plus or Ultra, install the latest beta update now. For that, you just need to open the Settings app >> tap on the Software Update >> click the Download and install option.\\nFull Changelog:\\nHome related error improvements\\nImproved Bluetooth related errors\\nMany other improvements\\n*Other: Screen ratio adjustment is officially applied as a display – screen ratio function.\\nContinue Reading\\nMost Popular\\n*\\nOne UI11 hours ago Samsung One UI 7 Beta: Everything you need to know *\\nOne UI3 days ago Official One UI 7 Update Plan – Here’s when Samsung’s Android 15 hits Galaxy S24, S23, S22 and more devices *\\nOne UI3 days ago Samsung releases One UI 7 Beta 6 with 6 new features for Galaxy S24 series *\\nApps3 days ago Samsung Reminder 12.6.00.42 update live for One UI 7 Galaxy devices\\nAbout Us\\nContact Us\\nCopyright Policy\\nPrivacy Policy\\nCopyright © 2025 SammyFans.com\", \"title\": \"Samsung One UI 7 Stable Update: Everything you need to know about the major software update for your Galaxy - Sammy Fans\", \"score\": 0.12748985, \"published_date\": \"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 15:13:17 GMT\", \"content\": \"*   User interest for One UI 7 overshadowed Android 15 and 16 *   One UI 7 Beta 2 update live for Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, Tab S10 Ultra In a recent development, Samsung has provided the Best Face AI feature to Galaxy S24 and S23 users with the latest One UI 7 Beta update. *   One UI11 hours ago Samsung One UI 7 Beta: Everything you need to know *   One UI3 days ago Official One UI 7 Update Plan – Here’s when Samsung’s Android 15 hits Galaxy S24, S23, S22 and more devices *   One UI3 days ago Samsung releases One UI 7 Beta 6 with 6 new features for Galaxy S24 series *   Apps3 days ago Samsung Reminder 12.6.00.42 update live for One UI 7 Galaxy devices\"}, {\"url\": \"https://www.theverge.com/news/639078/samsung-bespoke-ai-jet-ultra-vacuum-text-messages\", \"raw_content\": \"Published Time: 2025-03-30T02:00:00+00:00\\nSamsung’s latest smart appliances are all about the screens. | The Verge\\nSkip to main content\\nThe homepage\\nSubscribeSign In\\n*\\nTech\\n*\\nReviews\\n*\\nScience\\n*\\nEntertainment\\n*\\nAI\\n*\\nMore\\nThe homepage\\nMenu\\nNavigation Drawer\\nLogin\\n/\\nSign Up\\nclose\\nSearch\\nTech\\nAll Tech\\nAmazon\\nApple\\nFacebook\\nGoogle\\nMicrosoft\\nSamsung\\nBusiness\\nCreators\\nMobile\\nPolicy\\nSecurity\\nTransportation\\nReviews\\nAll Reviews\\nBuying Guides\\nDeals\\nGift Guide\\nLaptops\\nPhones\\nHeadphones\\nTablets\\nSmart Home\\nSmartwatches\\nSpeakers\\nDrones\\nScience\\nAll Science\\nSpace\\nEnergy\\nEnvironment\\nHealth\\nCOVID-19\\nEntertainment\\nAll Entertainment\\nGames\\nTV Shows\\nMovies\\nAudio\\nAI\\nCars\\nAll Cars\\nElectric Cars\\nAutonomous Cars\\nRide-Sharing\\nScooters\\nOther Transportation\\nFeatures\\nVideos\\nAll Videos\\nYouTube\\nTikTok\\nInstagram\\nPodcasts\\nAll Podcasts\\nDecoder\\nThe Vergecast\\nNewsletters\\nAll Newsletters\\nCommand Line\\nInstaller\\nNotepad\\nVerge Deals\\nStore\\nSubscribe\\nSamsung’s latest stick vac can alert you to calls and text messages\\n2\\nComments Drawer\\nNews\\nSamsung’s latest stick vac can alert you to calls and text messages\\nThe Bespoke Jet AI now comes with an LCD display that connects to your phone to show incoming calls and texts.

And you can even make a phone call through the new washer and dryer.\\nby Jennifer Pattison Tuohy\\nMar 30, 2025, 2:00 AM UTC\\n2 Comments / 2 New\\nSamaung’s new Bespoke AI Jet Ultra cordless stick vacuum has an\\nAI cleaning mode that senses floor types and automatically adjusts suction power and brush speed.\\nImage: Samsung\\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy is a smart home reporter who’s been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News.\\nIn our notification-heavy world, there is still one activity where you might just miss that buzz on your phone or ping on your smartwatch – while you’re vacuuming. Thankfully, Samsung has a solution.\\nIts newest cordless stick vac, the new Bespoke AI Jet Ultra ($1,099), now has an LCD display control panel that, along with standard features such as power level and battery life, can notify you when you have an incoming phone call or text message. The vacuum, which works with an auto-empty charging station, also features 400AW suction and 100-minute battery life.\\nEven better, if you’re doing the wash and left your phone in the other room, Samsung’s added touchscreens to its washers and dryers, including the new Bespoke AI Laundry Vented Combo washer / dryer ($3,099). This lets you answer a call directly on the built-in 7-inch LCD screen. The Combo can also (perhaps more usefully) put detergent in for you automatically and then, when the cycle is done, open its door.\\nThe new Bespoke combo washer and dryer has several tech upgrades, including a new 7-inch touchscreen that you can make phone calls on.\\nImage: Samsung\\nThe company has been rolling out the ability to answer your phone from your appliance to its entire Bespoke AI line. At CES this year, Samsung showed off these AI Home control panels on several appliances, including its new Bespoke AI smart fridges and wall ovens. The features work with Android and iOS and require a Samsung account and the SmartThings app.\\nAI Home is a new terminology Samsung uses to refer to the 7- or 9-inch LCD screens on its products and the screens built into its flagship Family Hub smart fridge. The fridge now has the option of a slimmed-down screen that — like the other AI Home screens — includes music, weather, and cooking apps, and smart home controls.\\nOf course, you can still get the fridge with a giant 21.5-inch or 32-inch screen that can run even more apps, including Samsung TV and TikTok. These screens all also work as controls for the appliance and integrate with other Samsung appliances and services, sometimes using AI.\\nThe flagship Samsung Family Hub smart fridge now comes with the option of a smaller screen.\\nFor example, on the fridge screen, you can look up a recipe in the Samsung Food app using ingredients it has identified you have using its AI-powered cameras. You can then send the cooking instructions to your oven and use the screen to view the recipe. It’s like having your phone with you everywhere, except your hands are free.\\nThe AI Home screens can connect to Samsung’s SmartThings smart home platform. That means you can get alerts on your appliances about other events in your smart home, for example, you can see (and talk to) whoever is at your Ring video doorbell while unloading the washer.\\nSamsung’s “screens everywhere” approach is part of its AI for the home push, its vision of tech working in the background to help you with your daily life. While the smart home has plenty of potential to save you time, money, and energy, putting screens into everything feels like overkill. A smart display could serve much of the same purpose, and would probably cost less to replace than a cooktop when you drop a pan on its screen.\\nTech-heavy touchscreens built into appliances also feel susceptible to obsolescence, not to mention being more likely to malfunction than that plastic knob on your washing machine. The other concern about screens in the home is that they could be used to serve up ads, as is the case with Amazon’s Echo Show smart displays. While Samsung has not done this yet on its appliances, it’s an understandable worry. The Verge reached out to Samsung about these concerns and will follow up with the company’s response.\\n2 Comments / 2 New\\nSee More:\\nNews\\nSamsung\\nSmart Home\\nTech\\nMore in this stream\\nSee all\\nFirst Alert’s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacement\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 2823\\nGoogle discontinues Nest Protect smoke alarm and Nest x Yale door lock\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 2838\\nYale’s new smart lock can match your Google Nest doorbell\\nJennifer Pattison TuohyMar 285\\nMost Popular\\nMost Popular\\nGoogle discontinues Nest Protect smoke alarm and Nest x Yale door lock\\nKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starter\\nWindows 11 is closing a loophole that let you skip making a Microsoft account\\nHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUs\\nMadison Square Garden’s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt design\\nInstaller\\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\\nEmail (required)\\nSign Up\\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

April is almost here, and Samsung has just two days to fulfill its promise of releasing One UI 7 Beta for the last eligible device.\\nSince the Galaxy A55 didn’t go on sale in the US, the Android 15-based One UI 7 Beta will remain a flagship offering. The Beta Program is live for the Galaxy S24 series in seven countries, while the Wave II devices are eligible in just four markets.\\nSimilar to the Galaxy S24 series, Android 15-based One UI 7 will be the first major upgrade for the Galaxy A55. It’s the only mid-range (non-flagship) Samsung device that is officially listed to enter the One UI 7 Beta Program.\\nEarlier, the company’s Indian subsidiary published a Beta noticeboard in the Members Community. It indicates that the preparations are underway but things may not go ahead as expected as Official rollout commencing on April 7.\\nSamsung indeed wants to run the One UI 7 Beta for the mid-range phone. However, it should be here in the next few days as the Stable rollout for smartphones like the Galaxy S24 series, the Z Flip 6, and Z Fold 6 could cause a delay.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe South Korean tech giant has just released the Galaxy A26, A36, and A56 globally. These new devices come pre-installed with the Android 15-based One UI 7.0.

With the recent One UI 7 Beta updates, Samsung expanded the Google Sports live scores feature to Now Bar on the Galaxy S24 and S23 series and the Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6.\\nWhile the One UI 7 Beta has added Google Sports to the Now Bar, the live scores are not updating on the Galaxy S24 series. The function exists in its relevant section within the One UI 7, but it’s not functional, as the live scores activity is broken.\\nIt has been found that the Google Sports is broken within the Discover feed. Despite following preferred teams for sports scores, the updates aren’t functioning.\\nAs Google Sports isn’t functional in Discover, Now Bar can’t show live updates. Samsung and Google may be aware of the cause, and a fix might be coming with the Stable build next month.\\nClearing the cache and app data won’t address the problem either. The bug renders you to wait until a fix comes through the One UI 7 Beta or Stable or an update to Google App.\\nAdvertisement\\nSamsung hasn’t yet acknowledged the problem, but the Stable update is set to arrive on April 7. Galaxy S24 series users may have live scores through the Now Bar once the update arrives.\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nGalaxy S23 gets revamped charging animation, new Now Bar features, and versatile Drawing Assist in latest One UI 7 Beta\\nPublished\\n11 hours agoon\\nMarch 29, 2025\\nBy\\nSheetal\\nSamsung Galaxy S23, Galaxy S23 Plus, and Galaxy S23 Ultra smartphones recently received the One UI 7 Beta 2 update, bringing new features and bug fixes to provide a smoother experience. Some of the highlighted upgraded functions in the latest One UI 7 Beta update for the Galaxy S23 include the charging animation, Now Bar, and Drawing Assist.\\nWith the latest beta update, users of the Galaxy S23 series can enjoy features similar to those of the Galaxy S25 series. However, the new features are already available to the Galaxy S24, Galaxy Z Flip 6, and Galaxy Z Fold 6 smartphones through the beta update. Let’s explore what Samsung brings with One UI 7 Beta for the charging animation, Now Bar, and Drawing Assist in the Galaxy S23 series.\\nNow Bar\\nThe latest update adds “Sports” from Google to the Live notification section of the Now Bar. This means you can now check sports scores directly from the Status Bar, Notification Panel, and a Dynamic Island-inspired UI through Live Notification.\\nAlso, you can view sports scores on the lock screen, using the Now Bar pill. You can also notice that the ” Live Notification” option on the top has been changed to “Now Bar.”\\nAdvertisement\\nNew\\nOld\\nCharging Animation\\nOne UI 7 Beta 2 update revamped the charging animation on the Galaxy S23, similar to other flagships testing the beta update. The revamped charging animation removes the solid background overlay. It significantly improves the overall appearance of the charging indicator, making it smoother.\\nNew\\nOld\\nDrawing Assist\\nWith the new update, Drawing Assist is much more versatile on the Galaxy S23 series. Now, users can create images not just from sketches, but also using text descriptions or image prompts. This gives you more ways to create AI-generated artwork.\\nAdditionally, the AI ​​has become better at understanding more complex inputs, which means the results are likely to be more realistic and creative.\\nAdvertisement\\nNew\\nold\\nIf you’re using the latest beta version of the Galaxy S23 smartphone, check out the new upgrades to enjoy these features even more.\\nHow to enable Sports Score Now Bar in Samsung One UI 7\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nSamsung One UI 7 Beta: Everything you need to know\\nPublished\\n24 hours agoon\\nMarch 28, 2025\\nBy\\nRobin Williams\\nAt the SDC 2024, we heard about the One UI 7 for the first time from Samsung, it was a brief introduction.

Yes, the Galaxy S25 launched with it, but it’s been months now and owners of the super-premium Galaxy S24 Ultra, or the Galaxy Z Fold 6 haven’t gotten a taste of the new Samsung software.\\nApple has failed to provide the massive Siri update we were supposed to get with iOS 18.4, and Samsung may have a 7-year software update promise, but if it takes months to get the new stuff, users start getting irritated.\\nAt least it’s now been confirmed — older Galaxies will be getting One UI 7 on the 7th of April if you are outside the States. In the USA, you will get it on the 10th.\\nHere's what you should expect to see:\\nSlightly redesigned icons\\nNew widgets with multiple shapes and designs for the Samsung apps\\nA new, vertical app drawer (switches to horizontal if you select Custom sorting, but that's a pain)\\nNotifications and Quick Toggles now separated — swipe down from top-right for the quick panel\\nNow Bar - a persistent, active widget, like the Dynamic Island\\nUpdated AI select - the old Smart Select that resided in the Edge Panel is now branded AI select as it automatically suggests actions\\nCamera app facelift - moving the controls around to make it cleaner and one-hand friendly\\nAI search in Samsung Gallery and Settings (maybe not coming to S21?)\\nNow Brief - a quick summary of your day and suggested actions\\nFaster Circle to Search - now automatically suggests actions based on selected content (call number, compose to email address, et cetera)\\nGenerate unique stickers with AI - new AI key in the Samsung Emoji keyboard (maybe not coming to S21?)\\nReceive the latest Samsung news\\nSubscribe\\nBy subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.\\nSome visual elements of One UI 7 have been criticized for moving away from the Samsung look and style — like the new quick toggles menu, which kind of looks like an iPhone Control Center if you squint. However, the smart search in Settings will be a big time saver if you haven't experienced it yet — you don't need to remember the exact name of a setting, just tell the search bar what you are trying to do. Looking through your picture gallery should now be easier, just like how it has been with Google Photos for some years now.\\nIn general, not a bad update, but nothing huge even though it brings a redesign to the table.

And you can even make a phone call through the new washer and dryer.\\nby Jennifer Pattison Tuohy\\nMar 30, 2025, 2:00 AM UTC\\n2 Comments / 2 New\\nSamaung’s new Bespoke AI Jet Ultra cordless stick vacuum has an\\nAI cleaning mode that senses floor types and automatically adjusts suction power and brush speed.\\nImage: Samsung\\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy is a smart home reporter who’s been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a contributor to Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, and US News.\\nIn our notification-heavy world, there is still one activity where you might just miss that buzz on your phone or ping on your smartwatch – while you’re vacuuming. Thankfully, Samsung has a solution.\\nIts newest cordless stick vac, the new Bespoke AI Jet Ultra ($1,099), now has an LCD display control panel that, along with standard features such as power level and battery life, can notify you when you have an incoming phone call or text message. The vacuum, which works with an auto-empty charging station, also features 400AW suction and 100-minute battery life.\\nEven better, if you’re doing the wash and left your phone in the other room, Samsung’s added touchscreens to its washers and dryers, including the new Bespoke AI Laundry Vented Combo washer / dryer ($3,099). This lets you answer a call directly on the built-in 7-inch LCD screen. The Combo can also (perhaps more usefully) put detergent in for you automatically and then, when the cycle is done, open its door.\\nThe new Bespoke combo washer and dryer has several tech upgrades, including a new 7-inch touchscreen that you can make phone calls on.\\nImage: Samsung\\nThe company has been rolling out the ability to answer your phone from your appliance to its entire Bespoke AI line. At CES this year, Samsung showed off these AI Home control panels on several appliances, including its new Bespoke AI smart fridges and wall ovens. The features work with Android and iOS and require a Samsung account and the SmartThings app.\\nAI Home is a new terminology Samsung uses to refer to the 7- or 9-inch LCD screens on its products and the screens built into its flagship Family Hub smart fridge. The fridge now has the option of a slimmed-down screen that — like the other AI Home screens — includes music, weather, and cooking apps, and smart home controls.\\nOf course, you can still get the fridge with a giant 21.5-inch or 32-inch screen that can run even more apps, including Samsung TV and TikTok. These screens all also work as controls for the appliance and integrate with other Samsung appliances and services, sometimes using AI.\\nThe flagship Samsung Family Hub smart fridge now comes with the option of a smaller screen.\\nFor example, on the fridge screen, you can look up a recipe in the Samsung Food app using ingredients it has identified you have using its AI-powered cameras. You can then send the cooking instructions to your oven and use the screen to view the recipe. It’s like having your phone with you everywhere, except your hands are free.\\nThe AI Home screens can connect to Samsung’s SmartThings smart home platform. That means you can get alerts on your appliances about other events in your smart home, for example, you can see (and talk to) whoever is at your Ring video doorbell while unloading the washer.\\nSamsung’s “screens everywhere” approach is part of its AI for the home push, its vision of tech working in the background to help you with your daily life. While the smart home has plenty of potential to save you time, money, and energy, putting screens into everything feels like overkill. A smart display could serve much of the same purpose, and would probably cost less to replace than a cooktop when you drop a pan on its screen.\\nTech-heavy touchscreens built into appliances also feel susceptible to obsolescence, not to mention being more likely to malfunction than that plastic knob on your washing machine. The other concern about screens in the home is that they could be used to serve up ads, as is the case with Amazon’s Echo Show smart displays.

In a recent development, Samsung has provided the Best Face AI feature to Galaxy S24 and S23 users with the latest One UI 7 Beta update.\\nWith the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung introduced Best Face, with the feature now available on the Galaxy S24 and S23 series and the A56. Levaraging AI, the functionality allows you to fix an individual or group photo effortlessly.\\nYou may have encountered a big issue while taking group selfies or pictures. In a group photo, the face of an individual or more may lead you to capture another photo due to closed eyes, different view point angle or any odd aspect.\\nWell, you will no longer need to capture dozens of photos to get the best group shot.\\nBest Face\\nWhen enabled, Best Face displays improvements for faces in a group shot. You can pick the most preferred shot from the display once and apply the fix. It will swiftly apply the chosen face on the individual while keeping others intact.\\nAdvertisement\\nNotably, Best Face only shows suggestions when the picture is captured in Motion Photo mode.

The update brings at least four new features and system improvements. Meanwhile, Gemini Live is causing One UI Home to crash on the Galaxy S23 series running One UI 7 Beta 2.\\nSamsung’s system launcher for home keeps crashing on the Galaxy S23 series with One UI 7 Beta 2, probably due to Gemini Live. It seems the new Google Assistant isn’t accurately optimized for the Galaxy S23 series, causing crash problems.\\nUsers of the Galaxy S23 series report that the home screen renders useless and then a crashing notice appears. The said notice allows the user to either wait for the system to respond or end the task to immediately resolve the problem.\\nNotably, users are able to reproduce the glitch. It happens when you open Gemini Live and then trigger the Live Notifications. As soon as you land on the home screen, the problem will appear, making the screen useless until the crash notice appears.\\nSince the issue is causing under Beta Program, it isn’t a big deal. As many users spotted the same problem, Samsung will address it in the next Beta update. There might also be a Beta 2 Hotfix to resolve the crashing issue quickly.\\nAdvertisement\\nApart from this, the home screen has another issue related to the Large Folders feature. The folder popup lacks a blur background, which reduces the uniformity of the software. A similar issue was spotted on the Galaxy S24’s One UI 7 Beta earlier.\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nUser interest for One UI 7 overshadowed Android 15 and 16\\nPublished\\n1 day agoon\\nMarch 27, 2025\\nBy\\nChanakya Shrutam\\nWeb searches for One UI 7 have increased on the internet for the past two months and already surpassed Android 15 and the upcoming version simultaneously in terms of users’ interest.\\nAndroid is the world’s largest mobile operating system, making an ecosystem of hundreds of companies, and Samsung has a unique role in popularizing Google’s OS with its vast device range.\\nIn the past five years, Samsung has deepened Android ecosystem’s integration in One UI. For example, it dropped some of the home-grown Google apps and service alternatives to act ‘more’ like an Android.\\nDespite an Android base, One UI 7 has gained massive popularity, which didn’t happen before, and here we’ll explore the possible reasons for this new development.\\nNew Upgrades\\nSamsung unveiled One UI 7 with major upgrades in animations, user interface and operational fluency. The software experience is much better than it predecessor, which is captivating for existing smartphone owners.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe beta program started with the Galaxy S24 series, 2024’s flagship phones, which triggered global media coverage about One UI 7 beta. The users were excited about new additions, revealed by early beta testers, generating excitement.\\nS25\\nThe real One UI 7 hype began with the Galaxy S25 series launch in mid-January. This new flagship was the first to pack with a stable software and a couple of additional features that weren’t even available for beta testers at that time.\\nThis year, Samsung majorly focused its launch event on the software and AI features compared and less on the hardware.\\nAgain, the majority of the media covered the Galaxy S25 series’ software side, making it even more compelling to the previous flagship users.\\nRollout delay\\nOne UI 7 is a big update, but its rollout delay is quite unsatisfying. The majority of Galaxy users weren’t aware of the One UI 7 (Android 15) rollout. This release suspense has garnered a mass internet search about eligible devices and release date.\\nAdvertisement\\nThis trend remained the same after the S25 release and picked up pace with every rumor and leak about this software’ release. On March 18, an official press-release finally unraveled Samsung’s April plan for One UI 7, ending this long-standing mystery.\\nSearch Trends\\nSince early December, I’ve seen tons of online articles about this new update. I also take a look at the Google Trends search volume from December 1, 2024, to March 25, 2025.\\nIt shows that One UI 7’s search volume is on par with Android 15, but its search interest is above both Android versions.\\nIt’s not about competition between Samsung and Google, instead, the search reflects the higher user interest in Samsung’s software technologies.\\nThis is also good for Google in terms of partnership with Samsung and promoting new capabilities such as Gemini and circle to search in Galaxy devices.\\nAdvertisement\\nStill, Samsung needs to work on its rollout efficiency to delivery software updates on time.\\nSource – Google Trends\\nContinue Reading\\nOne UI\\nOne UI 7 Beta 2 update live for Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, Tab S10 Ultra\\nPublished\\n2 days agoon\\nMarch 27, 2025\\nBy\\nSheetal\\nSamsung has pushed the One UI 7 Beta 2 update for Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra devices.
